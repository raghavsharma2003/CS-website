## Understanding CBAM Embedded Emissions Framework for Indian Steel

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes a mandatory carbon accounting framework for steel imports entering the European Union. For Indian steel manufacturers, this regulation fundamentally transforms export compliance requirements by introducing forensic-level emissions reporting obligations.

Embedded emissions represent the total greenhouse gas emissions released during the production of steel goods, measured in tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of product. The regulation defines embedded emissions as direct emissions from the production process plus indirect emissions from electricity consumption, calculated at the installation level where production occurs.

Indian steel producers must understand that CBAM distinguishes between "simple goods" and "complex goods" within CN codes 7208-7229. Simple goods include hot-rolled coils and plates produced directly from liquid steel, while complex goods encompass cold-rolled products requiring additional processing steps. Each category demands specific calculation methodologies aligned with the installation's actual production data.

The regulation prioritizes actual emissions data over default values, requiring Indian manufacturers to implement monitoring systems capable of capturing real-time production emissions. This forensic approach ensures accuracy in carbon intensity calculations while preventing reliance on generic emission factors that may not reflect India's diverse steel production landscape.

## Production Route-Specific Calculation Methodologies

Indian steel production predominantly follows three distinct technological pathways, each requiring tailored embedded emissions calculations under CBAM requirements. The blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) route, representing approximately 45% of Indian capacity, involves iron ore reduction using metallurgical coke, generating significant direct CO2 emissions from limestone flux and carbon combustion.

For BF-BOF installations, embedded emissions calculations must capture:
- Direct emissions from coke combustion in blast furnaces
- Process emissions from limestone decomposition in BOF operations  
- Indirect emissions from electricity consumption in auxiliary systems
- Precursor emissions from iron ore pellets and sinter production

Electric arc furnace (EAF) operations, constituting roughly 55% of Indian steel capacity, present different calculation challenges. EAF embedded emissions primarily derive from electricity consumption and electrode oxidation, with minimal process emissions compared to BF-BOF routes. Indian EAF producers must document their scrap steel ratios and electricity grid emission factors for accurate carbon intensity determination.

The direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) pathway, particularly prevalent among Indian secondary producers, requires specific attention to natural gas consumption in DRI kilns. These installations must calculate embedded emissions from natural gas combustion, electricity usage in EAF operations, and any coal-based DRI production where applicable.

Installation-level calculations must account for system boundaries defined in Regulation (EU) 2023/956, ensuring all emissions within the production facility are captured. This includes auxiliary operations such as oxygen plants, water treatment systems, and material handling equipment that contribute to the overall carbon footprint of steel production.

## Precursor Materials and Aggregated Goods Integration

CBAM regulations require comprehensive accounting of precursor materials embedded within steel production chains. For Indian manufacturers, this necessitates forensic tracking of iron ore pellets, sinter, and metallurgical coke as material inputs with inherent carbon content requiring separate emissions calculations.

Iron ore pellets produced at Indian installations must be treated as precursors when consumed in blast furnace operations. The embedded emissions calculation must include direct emissions from pelletizing furnaces, typically fired with coal or natural gas, plus electricity consumption for pellet handling and processing systems. Indian pellet producers must provide installation-specific emission factors to downstream steel manufacturers for accurate CBAM reporting.

Sinter production represents another critical precursor requiring emissions quantification. Indian sinter plants generate direct emissions from coke breeze combustion and limestone flux decomposition during the sintering process. The calculation methodology must capture these process emissions alongside electricity consumption for sinter handling and cooling operations.

Metallurgical coke, whether produced on-site or purchased from merchant coke plants, contributes embedded emissions through coal carbonization processes. Indian steel producers utilizing captive coke ovens must calculate direct emissions from coal heating and byproduct recovery operations, while those purchasing merchant coke must obtain supplier-specific emission factors for accurate precursor accounting.

Aggregated goods within the steel sector, such as coated products or fabricated structures, require additive calculations incorporating base steel embedded emissions plus processing-specific emissions from coating operations, forming processes, or assembly activities. This forensic approach ensures complete carbon accounting across complex steel product value chains.

## Installation-Level Monitoring and Verification Protocols

Regulation (EU) 2023/956 mandates installation-specific emissions monitoring systems capable of generating forensic-grade data for CBAM compliance. Indian steel manufacturers must establish continuous monitoring protocols covering direct process emissions, electricity consumption, and fuel input tracking with quarterly verification requirements.

Direct emissions monitoring requires installation of continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) at major emission sources including blast furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, electric arc furnaces, and auxiliary combustion equipment. These systems must measure CO2 concentrations and volumetric flow rates with accuracy standards meeting EU monitoring and reporting regulation requirements.

Electricity consumption monitoring demands sub-metering systems capable of attributing power usage to specific production processes within the installation. Indian manufacturers must distinguish between electricity consumed for steel production versus non-production activities, ensuring accurate allocation of indirect emissions to CBAM-covered goods.

Fuel input tracking systems must capture consumption data for all carbon-containing fuels including metallurgical coke, natural gas, coal, and biomass where applicable. Mass flow measurements with appropriate uncertainty calculations provide the foundation for accurate direct emissions calculations using installation-specific emission factors.

Verification protocols require independent third-party validation of monitoring systems and emissions calculations on a quarterly basis during the transitional period. Indian installations must engage accredited verification bodies familiar with steel production processes and CBAM requirements to ensure data quality and regulatory compliance.

Advanced installations may implement forensic data extraction systems like CarbonSettle to automate emissions calculations and generate compliant XML reports for EU registry submission. Such systems integrate production data, fuel consumption records, and electricity usage into comprehensive carbon accounting platforms meeting CBAM technical requirements.

## CBAM Reporting Requirements and Documentation Standards

The EU's transitional registry system requires quarterly submission of embedded emissions data through standardized XML formats containing installation-level production and emissions information. Indian steel exporters must prepare comprehensive documentation supporting their embedded emissions calculations with forensic-level detail and verification.

XML report generation requires structured data including installation identification codes, production volumes by CN code, direct and indirect emissions quantities, and electricity consumption figures. The reporting format demands precision in data classification, ensuring proper allocation of emissions to specific steel products covered under CBAM scope.

Documentation standards mandate retention of supporting records including fuel consumption invoices, electricity bills, production logs, and verification reports for potential EU authority review. Indian manufacturers must establish document management systems capable of providing audit trails linking reported emissions data to underlying production records.

Installation operators must designate authorized representatives responsible for CBAM reporting obligations, ensuring proper registration with EU authorities and timely submission of quarterly reports. These representatives require technical competency in carbon accounting methodologies and familiarity with steel production processes to ensure accurate data reporting.

Quality assurance procedures must validate embedded emissions calculations before report submission, incorporating internal review processes and external verification where required. Indian installations should implement systematic checking procedures to identify potential errors or inconsistencies in emissions data before regulatory submission.

Forensic data extraction platforms can streamline the reporting process by automatically generating compliant XML files from production management systems, reducing manual data entry errors and ensuring consistent formatting across reporting periods. Such automation becomes particularly valuable for installations with complex production configurations or multiple product lines requiring separate emissions calculations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do Indian steel manufacturers determine which emission factors to use for embedded emissions calculations under CBAM?**

A: Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes a clear hierarchy prioritizing actual installation data over default values. Indian manufacturers must first attempt to use installation-specific emission factors derived from their own monitoring systems and fuel analysis. Where installation-specific data is unavailable, they may use country-specific factors for India, followed by regional factors, and only as a last resort, the default values provided in CBAM implementing acts. The regulation emphasizes that actual data provides more accurate carbon intensity calculations and reduces compliance risks. Installations should invest in monitoring systems capable of generating installation-specific emission factors for major fuel types including metallurgical coke, natural gas, and coal used in steel production processes.

**Q: What specific documentation must Indian steel exporters maintain to support their embedded emissions calculations during potential EU authority audits?**

A: Indian steel exporters must maintain comprehensive documentation including continuous emissions monitoring system records, fuel consumption invoices with carbon content analysis, electricity consumption data with grid emission factors, production logs showing steel output by product type, verification reports from accredited third parties, and calculation worksheets demonstrating embedded emissions methodology. The documentation must provide clear audit trails linking reported emissions data to underlying production activities. Records should be retained for at least five years and must be readily accessible for EU authority review. Installation operators should implement document management systems ensuring data integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications. Additionally, any changes to calculation methodologies or monitoring systems must be documented with justification and approval records.

**Q: How should Indian DRI-EAF producers calculate embedded emissions when using both natural gas and coal-based DRI in their operations?**

A: Indian DRI-EAF producers using mixed feedstock must implement separate calculation streams for each DRI type based on their respective production processes. Natural gas-based DRI requires emissions calculations covering direct combustion emissions from natural gas consumption, process emissions from iron oxide reduction, and electricity consumption for material handling and cooling systems. Coal-based DRI calculations must account for direct emissions from coal combustion, process emissions from reduction reactions, and associated electricity usage. The final embedded emissions for steel products must reflect the weighted average based on the proportion of each DRI type consumed in EAF operations. Producers must maintain detailed records of DRI consumption by type and implement monitoring systems capable of tracking fuel usage for each DRI production route. This segregated approach ensures accurate carbon intensity calculations reflecting the actual production mix at the installation level.
