## Key Takeaways

The Authorised Declarant represents the cornerstone of EU CBAM compliance architecture, bearing primary legal responsibility for accurate carbon emissions reporting and certificate surrender. Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, this entity must maintain forensic-level documentation standards, implement robust verification protocols, and ensure seamless coordination between upstream producers and EU regulatory authorities. Indian steel exporters must understand that the Authorised Declarant's operational failures directly translate to financial penalties, market access restrictions, and potential supply chain disruptions affecting multi-million euro trade relationships.

## Regulatory Framework and Legal Foundation

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism establishes the Authorised Declarant as the primary compliance entity responsible for CBAM obligations within EU territory. This designation carries significant legal weight, as the Authorised Declarant assumes full liability for emissions data accuracy, certificate procurement, and regulatory reporting compliance.

Under Article 17 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the Authorised Declarant must be either the importer of CBAM goods or a customs representative acting on behalf of the importer with explicit authorization. This entity bears exclusive responsibility for submitting CBAM declarations, surrendering CBAM certificates, and maintaining comprehensive audit trails for all covered imports.

The regulatory framework mandates that Authorised Declarants establish robust internal control systems capable of processing complex emissions data from multiple upstream sources. These systems must accommodate varying data quality levels, implement standardized verification protocols, and ensure seamless integration with EU customs procedures.

For Indian steel exporters, understanding the Authorised Declarant's regulatory position proves crucial for establishing effective compliance partnerships. The selection of an inadequately prepared Authorised Declarant can result in systematic compliance failures, affecting entire export portfolios and long-term market access strategies.

## Operational Responsibilities and Compliance Obligations

The Authorised Declarant's operational mandate encompasses multiple interconnected responsibilities requiring sophisticated coordination capabilities. Primary obligations include emissions data collection, verification protocol implementation, certificate procurement, and regulatory reporting submission within prescribed timeframes.

Data collection responsibilities extend beyond simple aggregation, requiring the Authorised Declarant to implement forensic-level verification procedures for upstream emissions calculations. This includes validating production methodologies, confirming electricity consumption factors, and verifying indirect emissions attributions across complex supply chains.

Certificate procurement represents a critical operational function, as the Authorised Declarant must accurately calculate required certificate quantities based on verified emissions data and current carbon pricing mechanisms. The entity must maintain sufficient certificate reserves to accommodate potential data revisions and regulatory adjustments throughout reporting periods.

Regulatory reporting obligations demand comprehensive documentation supporting all emissions calculations, verification procedures, and certificate transactions. The Authorised Declarant must prepare detailed submissions demonstrating compliance with technical requirements while maintaining full audit trail capabilities for potential regulatory investigations.

Indian steel producers must recognize that Authorised Declarant operational failures directly impact export viability, as inadequate performance can trigger penalty assessments exceeding €50 per tonne of CO2 equivalent for non-compliance incidents.

## Documentation Standards and Audit Trail Requirements

CBAM compliance demands forensic-level documentation standards, with the Authorised Declarant serving as the primary custodian of all supporting evidence. Documentation requirements encompass production data, emissions calculations, verification reports, and certificate transaction records maintained according to EU regulatory specifications.

Production documentation must include detailed process descriptions, energy consumption records, raw material specifications, and output quantities with corresponding quality certifications. The Authorised Declarant must ensure all production data aligns with recognized international standards and demonstrates traceability throughout manufacturing processes.

Emissions calculation documentation requires comprehensive supporting evidence for all carbon intensity determinations, including electricity grid factors, process emissions coefficients, and indirect emissions allocations. Each calculation must reference approved methodologies and demonstrate consistency with EU technical requirements.

Verification documentation encompasses third-party assessment reports, internal audit findings, and corrective action implementations addressing identified deficiencies. The Authorised Declarant must maintain complete records of all verification activities, including assessor qualifications and methodology applications.

Audit trail requirements mandate that all documentation remains accessible for regulatory inspection throughout prescribed retention periods, typically extending 5 years beyond initial submission dates. The Authorised Declarant must implement secure storage systems ensuring document integrity and preventing unauthorized modifications.

## Verification Protocols and Quality Assurance

The Authorised Declarant must implement comprehensive verification protocols ensuring emissions data accuracy and regulatory compliance. These protocols encompass multiple verification layers, including internal quality checks, third-party assessments, and regulatory validation procedures.

Internal verification protocols require systematic review of all emissions calculations, supporting documentation, and compliance determinations before regulatory submission. The Authorised Declarant must establish clear verification hierarchies with defined responsibility assignments and escalation procedures for identified discrepancies.

Third-party verification represents a mandatory component for installations exceeding 25,000 tonnes CO2 equivalent annually, requiring engagement of accredited verification bodies meeting EU regulatory standards. The Authorised Declarant must coordinate verification activities, provide necessary documentation access, and implement recommended corrective actions within prescribed timeframes.

Quality assurance protocols must address potential data inconsistencies, calculation errors, and documentation deficiencies through systematic review procedures. The Authorised Declarant must maintain comprehensive quality management systems demonstrating continuous improvement capabilities and regulatory compliance maintenance.

For Indian steel exporters, verification protocol effectiveness directly impacts market access sustainability, as systematic verification failures can trigger enhanced regulatory scrutiny and potential trade restrictions affecting entire product portfolios.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transition from CBAM's transitional phase to full implementation during 2025-2026 significantly amplifies Authorised Declarant responsibilities and compliance complexity. Beginning January 2026, financial obligations commence with mandatory certificate surrender requirements based on verified emissions data.

Enhanced reporting obligations during 2025-2026 include quarterly CBAM declarations replacing current annual submissions, requiring Authorised Declarants to implement accelerated data processing capabilities. These shortened reporting cycles demand sophisticated information management systems capable of processing complex emissions data within compressed timeframes.

Certificate market dynamics during 2025-2026 will require Authorised Declarants to develop advanced procurement strategies addressing price volatility, supply availability, and regulatory adjustments. Market analysis indicates potential certificate prices ranging from €75-€100 per tonne CO2 equivalent, representing significant financial exposures for major importers.

Penalty enforcement mechanisms become fully operational during 2026, with Authorised Declarants facing potential sanctions including financial penalties, enhanced monitoring requirements, and temporary import restrictions for systematic compliance failures. These enforcement measures create substantial operational risks requiring comprehensive risk management strategies.

Indian steel exporters must prepare for intensified Authorised Declarant selection criteria during 2025-2026, as inadequately prepared entities may withdraw from CBAM markets due to increased compliance complexity and financial exposure levels.

## Strategic Partnership Considerations for Indian Exporters

Indian steel exporters must approach Authorised Declarant selection through comprehensive due diligence processes evaluating technical capabilities, financial stability, and regulatory compliance track records. Partnership decisions directly impact long-term market access and competitive positioning within EU markets.

Technical capability assessments should examine the prospective Authorised Declarant's information management systems, verification protocol implementation, and regulatory reporting capabilities. Exporters must verify that selected partners possess adequate technical infrastructure supporting complex emissions data processing and regulatory compliance maintenance.

Financial stability evaluations must consider the Authorised Declarant's capacity to procure necessary CBAM certificates, maintain compliance reserves, and absorb potential penalty exposures without compromising operational continuity. Financial assessments should include credit ratings, liquidity positions, and insurance coverage adequacy.

Regulatory compliance track records provide crucial insights into prospective partners' operational effectiveness and risk management capabilities. Exporters should examine historical compliance performance, regulatory relationship quality, and corrective action implementation effectiveness across comparable regulatory frameworks.

Partnership agreements must establish clear responsibility allocations, performance standards, and remediation procedures addressing potential compliance failures. These agreements should include specific performance metrics, penalty allocation mechanisms, and termination procedures protecting exporter interests during partnership dissolution scenarios.
