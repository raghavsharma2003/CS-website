## Understanding Emission Scope Classifications Under EU CBAM

The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) introduces stringent requirements for emissions reporting across industrial sectors, with steel manufacturing facing particularly complex obligations. Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, Indian steel exporters must demonstrate comprehensive understanding of emission scope classifications to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain market access.

Emission scope classification follows the internationally recognized Greenhouse Gas Protocol framework, which categorizes emissions into three distinct scopes based on operational control and ownership. For steel manufacturing operations, the distinction between Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions carries significant implications for CBAM certificate calculations and carbon pricing obligations.

The regulatory framework requires steel producers to establish clear boundaries between direct operational emissions and indirect emissions from purchased energy sources. This classification directly impacts the carbon intensity calculations that determine CBAM certificate requirements for EU imports.

## Scope 1 Emissions in Steel Manufacturing Operations

Scope 1 emissions represent direct greenhouse gas emissions occurring from sources owned or controlled by the steel manufacturing facility. These emissions result from combustion processes, chemical reactions, and fugitive emissions within the operational boundary of the steel plant.

Primary sources of Scope 1 emissions in integrated steel plants include coke oven operations, where coal undergoes pyrolysis to produce metallurgical coke, generating significant CO2 emissions. Blast furnace operations contribute substantial emissions through the reduction of iron ore using coke as both fuel and reducing agent. The basic oxygen furnace process, where molten iron converts to steel through oxygen injection, produces additional direct emissions.

Process-specific emissions encompass limestone calcination in sintering operations, where calcium carbonate decomposes to calcium oxide, releasing CO2 as a byproduct. Fuel combustion in reheating furnaces, annealing operations, and auxiliary equipment generates direct emissions attributable to the facility's operational control.

Quantification methodologies for Scope 1 emissions require continuous monitoring systems capable of measuring emissions at individual process units. Mass balance approaches, utilizing carbon input-output calculations, provide alternative measurement methods where direct monitoring proves technically unfeasible.

Indian steel plants typically generate 1.8 to 2.2 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per tonne of crude steel produced through Scope 1 emission sources, representing the majority of total facility emissions. This figure varies based on production technology, raw material quality, and operational efficiency parameters.

## Scope 2 Emissions from Purchased Energy Sources

Scope 2 emissions encompass indirect emissions resulting from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the steel manufacturing facility. These emissions occur at the generation source but are attributed to the consuming facility based on energy procurement decisions.

Electricity consumption represents the primary component of Scope 2 emissions in steel plants, powering electric arc furnaces, rolling mills, oxygen production units, and auxiliary systems. The carbon intensity of purchased electricity depends on the regional grid emission factor, which varies significantly across Indian states based on energy mix composition.

Steam procurement from external sources contributes to Scope 2 emissions when facilities purchase process steam rather than generating it internally. District heating systems, where available, represent additional Scope 2 emission sources requiring careful quantification and reporting.

Market-based accounting methodologies allow facilities to claim reduced Scope 2 emissions through renewable energy certificates or power purchase agreements with clean energy sources. Location-based accounting applies regional grid emission factors regardless of specific procurement arrangements.

The emission factor for Indian grid electricity averages approximately 0.82 kg CO2 per kWh, though this varies by regional grid and time of consumption. Steel plants consuming 500-600 kWh per tonne of steel production generate approximately 0.4-0.5 tonnes of CO2 equivalent through Scope 2 emissions.

## CBAM Reporting Requirements for Emission Scopes

EU CBAM regulations establish specific reporting obligations for both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, requiring detailed documentation of emission sources, quantification methodologies, and verification procedures. The transitional period mandates quarterly reporting through the CBAM Transitional Registry, with comprehensive emission data submission requirements.

Scope 1 emission reporting requires facility-level data disaggregated by production process, including emissions from fuel combustion, process reactions, and fugitive sources. Installation-specific emission factors must be calculated based on actual operational data rather than generic industry benchmarks.

Scope 2 emission reporting demands documentation of electricity and steam consumption patterns, supplier-specific emission factors, and evidence of renewable energy procurement where applicable. Market-based accounting requires contractual evidence of clean energy purchases and corresponding emission factor adjustments.

Verification requirements mandate independent third-party validation of emission calculations, monitoring systems, and data quality assurance procedures. Accredited verifiers must confirm compliance with EU monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) standards established under the EU Emissions Trading System.

Data quality standards require uncertainty assessments for all emission calculations, with maximum permissible uncertainty thresholds specified for different measurement approaches. Continuous improvement obligations mandate regular review and enhancement of monitoring systems and calculation methodologies.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period concluding December 31, 2026, represents a critical juncture for Indian steel exporters, as financial obligations under CBAM commence January 1, 2027. During 2025-2026, regulatory authorities will intensify scrutiny of emission reporting quality and verification procedures.

Enhanced monitoring requirements will demand upgraded measurement systems capable of real-time emission tracking and automated data collection. Indian facilities must invest in continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) and process control technologies to meet evolving accuracy standards.

Benchmark development activities during 2025-2026 will establish sector-specific performance standards against which individual facility emissions are evaluated. These benchmarks will influence the calculation of free allocation equivalents and determine the scope of CBAM certificate obligations.

Verification infrastructure expansion requires development of domestic technical expertise and accreditation of Indian verification bodies under EU recognition schemes. This capacity building initiative will reduce compliance costs and improve verification accessibility for Indian exporters.

Digital reporting platform enhancements will streamline data submission processes and integrate with existing Indian regulatory systems. Interoperability between CBAM reporting requirements and domestic carbon accounting frameworks will reduce administrative burden on steel producers.

## Implementation Strategies for Indian Steel Plants

Successful CBAM compliance requires systematic implementation of emission monitoring and reporting systems aligned with EU regulatory requirements. Steel plants must establish dedicated carbon accounting teams with technical expertise in emission quantification and regulatory compliance.

Technology investment priorities should focus on upgrading measurement infrastructure to achieve required accuracy standards for both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Integration of process control systems with emission monitoring equipment enables automated data collection and reduces manual reporting errors.

Supplier engagement programs must address Scope 2 emission factors for purchased electricity and steam, requiring collaboration with utility providers to obtain accurate emission data. Long-term power purchase agreements with renewable energy sources can reduce Scope 2 emissions and associated CBAM obligations.

Training programs for technical staff should cover emission calculation methodologies, data quality assurance procedures, and regulatory compliance requirements. Regular updates ensure awareness of evolving regulatory interpretations and technical guidance documents.

Internal audit systems must verify emission calculation accuracy and identify potential compliance gaps before external verification activities. Continuous monitoring of regulatory developments enables proactive adaptation to changing requirements and maintains competitive positioning in EU markets.
