## Understanding CBAM Scope for Pickling and Drawing Operations

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes comprehensive monitoring requirements for steel processing operations, including pickling and drawing processes that constitute integral components of the steel value chain. These downstream operations, while not primary steel production activities, generate significant embedded carbon through energy consumption, chemical usage, and waste treatment processes that must be accurately quantified for CBAM compliance.

Pickling operations involve the removal of oxide scales from steel surfaces using acidic solutions, typically hydrochloric or sulfuric acid, generating direct emissions through acid regeneration systems and indirect emissions through substantial electricity consumption for ventilation, pumping, and heating systems. Drawing processes, encompassing wire drawing, tube drawing, and bar drawing operations, consume considerable electrical energy for mechanical deformation equipment while generating minimal direct emissions.

The regulatory framework requires operators to establish monitoring boundaries that capture all emission sources within the installation perimeter, including auxiliary processes such as acid storage, waste treatment facilities, and quality control laboratories. Installation-level monitoring must differentiate between emissions attributable to different steel grades and processing routes to enable accurate carbon intensity calculations for specific product categories subject to CBAM obligations.

## Direct Emissions Monitoring Requirements

Direct emissions from pickling operations primarily originate from acid regeneration systems where spent pickling liquor undergoes thermal treatment to recover usable acid while generating carbon dioxide emissions. The combustion of natural gas or other fuels in regeneration furnaces constitutes the primary direct emission source, requiring continuous monitoring through certified measurement systems compliant with EN 14181 standards.

Measurement uncertainty requirements specify maximum permissible deviations of 7.5% for installations exceeding 25,000 tonnes CO2 annually, with quarterly calibration protocols mandatory for all monitoring equipment. Acid regeneration systems must maintain detailed fuel consumption records with calorific value determinations conducted monthly using accredited laboratory analysis methods conforming to ISO 17025 standards.

Secondary direct emissions arise from limestone consumption in neutralization processes where calcium carbonate reacts with excess acid to form calcium chloride and carbon dioxide. These process emissions require stoichiometric calculations based on limestone consumption data, with emission factors of 0.44 tCO2/t limestone applied consistently across reporting periods.

Fugitive emissions from acid storage tanks and transfer systems necessitate quarterly leak detection surveys using infrared camera technology or equivalent detection methods capable of identifying emission sources below 100 ppm concentration levels. Documentation must include survey reports, repair records, and emission quantification calculations using EPA Protocol 21 methodologies or equivalent European standards.

## Indirect Emissions Calculation Methodologies

Electricity consumption represents the dominant indirect emission source for both pickling and drawing operations, requiring hourly consumption monitoring through certified meter systems with data logging capabilities and remote transmission protocols. Grid emission factors must reflect the actual electricity supply arrangements, utilizing supplier-specific emission factors where available or defaulting to national grid averages published by competent authorities.

Drawing operations typically consume 150-300 kWh per tonne of processed steel, varying significantly based on reduction ratios, material properties, and equipment efficiency characteristics. Multi-pass drawing operations require allocation methodologies that distribute electricity consumption across individual processing steps to enable product-specific carbon intensity calculations for different wire or tube specifications.

Heat treatment operations associated with drawing processes, including annealing furnaces and stress relief systems, generate substantial indirect emissions through natural gas consumption for atmosphere control and temperature maintenance. Monitoring protocols must capture fuel consumption data with monthly meter readings and quarterly calorific value determinations to ensure accurate emission calculations.

Compressed air systems, hydraulic power units, and cooling water circulation systems constitute additional indirect emission sources requiring sub-metering installations to enable accurate allocation to specific production activities. Energy management systems must provide automated data collection with exception reporting capabilities to identify consumption anomalies and equipment malfunctions affecting emission calculations.

## Process-Specific Emission Factors and Benchmarking

Hydrochloric acid consumption in pickling operations generates embedded carbon through the production process, with industry-standard emission factors averaging 0.85 tCO2 per tonne of HCl consumed based on European chemical industry benchmarking studies. These factors must be updated annually to reflect technological improvements and energy efficiency gains in acid production processes.

Sulfuric acid alternatives exhibit different emission profiles, with production emission factors typically ranging from 0.15-0.25 tCO2/t H2SO4 depending on manufacturing routes and energy sources utilized by chemical suppliers. Procurement specifications should require suppliers to provide product-specific carbon intensity declarations supported by third-party verification to enable accurate embedded emission calculations.

Wire drawing lubricants and drawing compounds contribute minor but measurable embedded emissions through their production and disposal processes. Consumption-based emission factors of 2.1 tCO2/t for synthetic lubricants and 1.8 tCO2/t for mineral-based alternatives provide reasonable approximations for installations lacking supplier-specific data.

Quality control processes including dimensional inspection, surface analysis, and mechanical testing generate indirect emissions through laboratory equipment operation and sample preparation activities. Standard emission factors of 0.05 tCO2/t processed material provide conservative estimates for installations without detailed laboratory energy monitoring systems.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period concluding in December 2025 requires Indian steel processors to establish fully operational monitoring systems capable of generating quarterly CBAM reports with complete emission data coverage. Installations processing more than 10,000 tonnes annually must implement automated data collection systems with real-time monitoring capabilities and exception reporting protocols.

Enhanced verification requirements effective January 2026 mandate third-party auditing of monitoring systems with annual verification reports submitted to competent authorities. Verification scope encompasses measurement equipment calibration, calculation methodologies, data management procedures, and internal quality assurance protocols with non-conformance reporting requirements.

Financial obligations commencing in 2026 require CBAM certificate purchases corresponding to embedded carbon content exceeding EU production benchmarks, with certificate prices linked to EU ETS allowance values averaging €85-95 per tonne CO2 based on current market projections. Price volatility mechanisms may result in quarterly certificate cost fluctuations exceeding 15%, requiring robust financial planning and hedging strategies.

Penalty frameworks for non-compliance include financial sanctions up to €50 per tonne of unreported emissions, with repeat violations subject to import suspension procedures lasting up to 12 months. Administrative burden increases substantially with monthly reporting requirements replacing quarterly submissions for installations with compliance deficiencies identified during verification audits.

## Documentation and Record-Keeping Protocols

Comprehensive documentation systems must maintain complete audit trails for all emission-relevant data with retention periods extending seven years beyond the reporting period. Electronic data management systems require backup procedures, access controls, and change tracking capabilities to ensure data integrity and regulatory compliance.

Monthly reconciliation procedures must verify consistency between production records, energy consumption data, and raw material inventories with variance investigations required for discrepancies exceeding 2% of monthly totals. Reconciliation reports must identify root causes for significant variances and document corrective actions implemented to prevent recurrence.

Quality assurance protocols require independent verification of key emission factors through annual supplier audits or third-party certification programs. Supplier declarations must include production facility locations, energy sources, and carbon intensity calculations supported by accredited verification bodies recognized under EU regulatory frameworks.

Training documentation must demonstrate personnel competency for monitoring system operation, data collection procedures, and calculation methodologies through formal certification programs or equivalent professional development activities. Annual training updates ensure continued compliance with evolving regulatory requirements and technical standards.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Are small-scale pickling operations below 1,000 tonnes annual capacity subject to CBAM monitoring requirements?**

A: All pickling operations processing steel products destined for EU export fall under CBAM scope regardless of installation size.
