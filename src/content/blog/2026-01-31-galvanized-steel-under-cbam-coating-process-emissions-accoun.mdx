## Understanding Galvanized Steel in CBAM Framework

Galvanized steel products fall under the iron and steel sector classification within the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. The regulatory framework treats galvanized steel as a distinct product category requiring specialized emissions accounting methodologies that capture both upstream steel production and downstream coating process emissions.

The galvanizing process involves immersing steel substrates in molten zinc baths at temperatures ranging from 445-465°C, creating metallurgical bonds that form protective zinc-iron alloy layers. This thermal process generates direct CO2 emissions from fuel combustion for bath heating, indirect emissions from electricity consumption for material handling systems, and process emissions from flux decomposition during surface preparation stages.

Under CBAM regulations, exporters must differentiate between embedded emissions from primary steel production and additional emissions attributable to the galvanizing coating process. This distinction requires implementation of process-level monitoring systems capable of isolating energy consumption and emissions sources specific to coating operations.

The carbon intensity of galvanized steel typically ranges from 2.1-2.4 tCO2e per tonne of finished product, representing a 7-12% increase over equivalent uncoated steel grades. This incremental carbon footprint stems primarily from natural gas combustion for zinc bath heating, which accounts for approximately 85% of coating-related emissions.

## Process-Level Emissions Identification and Quantification

Galvanizing operations generate emissions through multiple pathways requiring discrete measurement and reporting protocols. Direct emissions originate from fuel combustion in zinc bath heating systems, typically utilizing natural gas or propane burners operating at thermal efficiencies of 75-85%. The stoichiometric combustion of natural gas produces 2.75 kg CO2 per cubic meter of gas consumed, establishing a direct correlation between fuel consumption and process emissions.

Indirect emissions result from electricity consumption across galvanizing line equipment including conveyor systems, ventilation fans, and automated handling mechanisms. The carbon intensity of consumed electricity depends on regional grid emission factors, which for Indian industrial facilities typically range from 0.82-0.91 tCO2e per MWh based on coal-dominated generation portfolios.

Process emissions emerge from flux decomposition during steel surface preparation, where ammonium chloride and zinc chloride compounds thermally decompose at temperatures exceeding 350°C. The decomposition reactions release CO2 and other greenhouse gases at rates proportional to flux consumption, typically 0.8-1.2 kg flux per tonne of galvanized product.

Zinc consumption represents an additional emissions source through embodied carbon in zinc metal production. Primary zinc smelting generates approximately 3.2 tCO2e per tonne of refined zinc, with coating applications consuming 50-120 kg zinc per tonne of steel substrate depending on coating thickness specifications.

Quantification methodologies must account for process efficiency variations, including zinc bath temperature fluctuations, line speed adjustments, and product mix changes affecting coating thickness requirements. These operational variables directly influence energy consumption patterns and associated emissions profiles.

## CBAM Reporting Requirements for Galvanized Products

Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes specific reporting obligations for galvanized steel exporters during the transitional period extending through December 31, 2026. Quarterly CBAM reports must include detailed emissions data disaggregated by production process, with separate accounting for base steel manufacturing and subsequent galvanizing operations.

The reporting framework requires documentation of direct emissions from coating process fuel combustion, calculated using facility-specific emission factors derived from fuel analysis and combustion efficiency measurements. Exporters must maintain continuous monitoring records demonstrating compliance with EU monitoring, reporting, and verification standards equivalent to those applied under the EU Emissions Trading System.

Indirect emissions reporting encompasses electricity consumption data with corresponding grid emission factors validated by competent national authorities. Indian exporters must utilize emission factors published by the Central Electricity Authority or obtain facility-specific factors through renewable energy certificate tracking systems for installations with dedicated clean energy procurement arrangements.

Product-specific emissions intensities require calculation methodologies accounting for coating thickness variations across product specifications. Standard coating designations (Z100, Z275, Z450) correspond to zinc coating masses of 100, 275, and 450 grams per square meter respectively, with proportional impacts on carbon intensity calculations.

The CBAM reporting system mandates submission of installation-level emissions data, production volumes, and embedded carbon calculations for each product category exported to EU markets. Non-compliance with reporting requirements triggers enforcement actions including import permit suspensions and financial penalties calculated based on unreported emission quantities.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period concluding December 31, 2026, represents a critical compliance window for Indian galvanized steel exporters establishing CBAM reporting capabilities. During 2025-2026, regulatory authorities will intensify verification procedures and audit protocols to ensure data quality and methodological consistency across reporting installations.

Enhanced monitoring requirements effective January 1, 2025, mandate implementation of continuous emissions monitoring systems for installations exceeding 25,000 tonnes annual galvanized steel production capacity. These systems must demonstrate measurement uncertainties below 5% for direct emissions and 7.5% for indirect emissions, requiring calibration protocols aligned with ISO 14064 standards.

The European Commission's implementing regulations scheduled for publication in Q2 2025 will establish detailed technical specifications for galvanized steel emissions accounting methodologies. These regulations will address coating thickness measurement protocols, zinc consumption tracking requirements, and standardized emission factors for common galvanizing process configurations.

Indian exporters must prepare for mandatory third-party verification requirements commencing January 1, 2026, necessitating engagement with accredited verification bodies possessing expertise in steel sector emissions accounting. Verification costs typically range from €15,000-35,000 per installation annually, depending on production complexity and data management system sophistication.

The regulatory transition period provides opportunities for exporters to optimize process efficiency and reduce carbon intensity through implementation of energy management systems, fuel switching initiatives, and waste heat recovery technologies. These improvements directly impact CBAM compliance costs and competitive positioning in EU markets post-2026.

## Technical Monitoring and Verification Protocols

Effective CBAM compliance for galvanized steel operations requires implementation of comprehensive monitoring protocols capturing process-level emissions data with requisite accuracy and reliability. Monitoring system design must accommodate the multi-stage nature of galvanizing operations, including steel preparation, flux application, zinc bath immersion, and cooling processes.

Direct emissions monitoring utilizes continuous measurement systems installed on zinc bath heating equipment, incorporating flow meters for fuel consumption tracking and analyzers for combustion gas composition analysis. These systems must demonstrate calibration stability over quarterly intervals and maintain measurement uncertainties within prescribed tolerance limits.

Temperature monitoring across zinc bath operations provides critical data for emissions calculations, as bath temperature directly correlates with fuel consumption rates and thermal efficiency parameters. Automated data logging systems must record temperature profiles at 15-minute intervals minimum, with data retention requirements extending 10 years for regulatory compliance purposes.

Zinc consumption tracking requires implementation of inventory management systems capable of reconciling zinc deliveries, bath additions, and coating thickness measurements. Mass balance calculations must account for zinc losses through dross formation and volatilization, typically representing 3-5% of total zinc consumption in well-managed operations.

Verification protocols mandate annual audits by accredited third parties possessing competency in steel sector emissions accounting and CBAM regulatory requirements. Verification scope encompasses data collection procedures, calculation methodologies, and quality assurance protocols implemented across galvanizing operations.

## Implementation Strategies for Indian Exporters

Indian galvanized steel exporters must develop comprehensive implementation strategies addressing technical, operational, and commercial aspects of CBAM compliance. Strategic planning should prioritize early adoption of monitoring systems and data management capabilities to ensure readiness for mandatory reporting requirements.

Investment in process optimization technologies offers dual benefits of emissions reduction and compliance cost mitigation. Heat recovery systems capturing waste heat from zinc bath operations can reduce fuel consumption by 15-25%, directly lowering carbon intensity calculations and associated CBAM obligations.

Supplier engagement programs must extend to zinc procurement strategies, prioritizing suppliers with documented low-carbon production processes and verified emissions data. Primary zinc production accounts for approximately 60% of coating-related embedded emissions, making supplier selection a critical factor in overall carbon footprint management.

Data management system development requires integration of process control systems, emissions monitoring equipment, and enterprise resource planning platforms to enable automated data collection and reporting capabilities. Cloud-based solutions offer scalability advantages and facilitate third-party verification access requirements.

Training programs for technical personnel must address CBAM regulatory requirements, emissions calculation methodologies, and monitoring system operation procedures. Competency development should encompass both operational staff and management personnel responsible for compliance oversight and strategic decision-making.

Market positioning strategies should emphasize low-carbon product offerings and transparent emissions reporting as competitive differentiators in EU markets. Early compliance demonstration provides commercial advantages during the transitional period and establishes credibility with European customers prioritizing supply chain sustainability.
