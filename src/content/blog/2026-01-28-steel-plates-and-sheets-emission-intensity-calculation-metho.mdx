## Production Route Classification and Baseline Methodologies

Steel plates and sheets production routes determine the fundamental calculation approach for emission intensity under EU CBAM requirements. Integrated steelmaking facilities utilizing blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) routes typically demonstrate emission intensities between 2.2-2.8 tCO₂e/tonne for hot-rolled products, while electric arc furnace (EAF) routes generally achieve 0.8-1.4 tCO₂e/tonne depending on scrap steel quality and electricity grid intensity.

The calculation methodology begins with production route identification according to Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Indian facilities must classify their operations as either integrated steelmaking, electric steelmaking, or secondary processing operations. This classification directly impacts the system boundaries for emission calculations and determines applicable default values during transitional periods.

Integrated facilities must account for coking coal preparation, sintering operations, blast furnace operations, and basic oxygen steelmaking within their system boundaries. The emission intensity calculation encompasses all direct emissions from carbon-containing inputs, process emissions from limestone decomposition, and indirect emissions from electricity consumption across the entire production chain.

Electric arc furnace operations require separate treatment of scrap-based and direct reduced iron (DRI) inputs. Facilities utilizing DRI must include upstream emissions from natural gas-based reduction processes, while scrap-based operations focus primarily on electricity-related emissions and electrode consumption. The distinction significantly impacts final emission intensity calculations, with DRI-based EAF routes typically showing 40-60% higher emission intensities than pure scrap-based operations.

## Scope 1 Direct Emissions Calculation Framework

Direct emissions calculation for steel plates and sheets encompasses all fossil fuel combustion and process emissions occurring within facility boundaries. The primary emission sources include coke oven operations, blast furnace carbon consumption, basic oxygen furnace decarburization, and auxiliary fuel consumption for reheating furnaces and rolling mill operations.

Coke consumption represents the largest single emission source in integrated steelmaking, typically accounting for 65-75% of total direct emissions. The calculation requires precise measurement of coke consumption per tonne of hot metal, with emission factors ranging from 3.2-3.4 tCO₂/tonne coke depending on volatile matter content and ash percentage. Indian facilities must implement continuous monitoring systems for coke quality parameters to ensure accurate emission factor application.

Process emissions from limestone flux consumption in steelmaking operations require separate quantification. The stoichiometric emission factor of 0.44 tCO₂/tonne limestone applies universally, but facilities must account for limestone purity and magnesium carbonate content in dolomitic limestone applications. Typical limestone consumption ranges from 40-80 kg per tonne of crude steel, contributing 0.018-0.035 tCO₂/tonne to overall emission intensity.

Natural gas consumption in reheating furnaces and annealing operations requires facility-specific measurement and monitoring. Emission factors of 2.35 tCO₂/1000 m³ natural gas apply for standard Indian pipeline gas compositions. Rolling mill operations typically consume 15-25 m³ natural gas per tonne of finished product, contributing 0.035-0.059 tCO₂/tonne to direct emissions.

## Scope 2 Indirect Emissions from Electricity Consumption

Electricity-related emissions calculation presents particular complexity for Indian steel exporters due to regional grid variations and facility-specific power purchase arrangements. The EU CBAM framework requires location-specific emission factors reflecting actual grid composition rather than national averages, creating challenges for facilities operating across multiple Indian grid regions.

Indian steel facilities typically consume 450-650 kWh electricity per tonne of finished steel plates and sheets, with cold-rolled products requiring additional 80-120 kWh for processing operations. Regional grid emission factors vary substantially across India, with Northern Grid showing 0.98 tCO₂/MWh, Western Grid at 0.89 tCO₂/MWh, Southern Grid at 0.82 tCO₂/MWh, Eastern Grid at 0.95 tCO₂/MWh, and North-Eastern Grid at 0.71 tCO₂/MWh according to latest Central Electricity Authority data.

Facilities with captive power generation must calculate emissions separately for self-generated electricity. Coal-based captive power plants typically demonstrate emission factors of 0.95-1.15 tCO₂/MWh depending on coal quality and plant efficiency. Natural gas-based captive generation shows emission factors around 0.35-0.42 tCO₂/MWh, while renewable energy sources contribute zero emissions to Scope 2 calculations.

Power purchase agreements with specific renewable energy sources require documentary evidence of additionality and temporal matching. Indian facilities claiming renewable electricity credits must demonstrate compliance with International REC Standard or equivalent certification schemes. The temporal matching requirement becomes increasingly stringent, requiring hourly matching by 2030 rather than annual balancing currently accepted.

## Hot-Rolled vs Cold-Rolled Product Differentiation

Hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel plates and sheets require distinct emission intensity calculations due to different processing requirements and energy consumption patterns. Hot-rolled products typically complete processing at the hot strip mill stage, while cold-rolled products undergo additional pickling, cold reduction, and annealing operations that increase overall emission intensity.

Hot-rolled steel plates and sheets demonstrate baseline emission intensities of 2.28-2.64 tCO₂/tonne for integrated steelmaking routes, depending on production efficiency and energy sources. The calculation encompasses all upstream steelmaking emissions allocated to the hot-rolled product based on mass balance principles. Facilities must account for yield losses throughout the production chain, with typical yields ranging from 85-92% from liquid steel to finished hot-rolled products.

Cold-rolled products require additional processing energy allocation, typically increasing emission intensity by 0.15-0.25 tCO₂/tonne compared to hot-rolled equivalents. Pickling operations consume 15-25 kWh/tonne electricity and generate acid regeneration emissions. Cold reduction mills consume 35-55 kWh/tonne, while continuous annealing lines require 80-120 kWh/tonne electricity plus natural gas consumption of 8-15 m³/tonne for heating operations.

Surface treatment operations for cold-rolled products, including galvanizing and organic coating, fall outside the steel plates and sheets CBAM scope but may affect system boundary definitions for integrated facilities. Facilities must clearly delineate emission allocations between CBAM-covered products and downstream processing operations to avoid double-counting or omission of relevant emissions.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period for EU CBAM implementation creates specific compliance challenges for Indian steel exporters during 2025-2026. Quarterly reporting requirements intensify accuracy demands, with default emission factors becoming increasingly punitive for facilities failing to implement adequate monitoring systems.

Default emission factors for steel plates and sheets increase by 10% annually during the transitional period, reaching 2.90 tCO₂/tonne for integrated steelmaking routes by 2026. This penalty structure incentivizes rapid implementation of facility-specific monitoring methodologies, requiring substantial investment in measurement equipment and data management systems.

The European Commission's implementing regulation, expected in Q2 2025, will specify detailed calculation methodologies and acceptable monitoring approaches. Indian facilities must prepare for potential retroactive adjustments to emission intensity calculations based on refined guidance. The implementing regulation will likely address treatment of electricity from renewable sources, allocation methods for multi-product facilities, and acceptable uncertainty levels for emission measurements.

Verification requirements become mandatory from 2026, requiring independent third-party validation of emission intensity calculations. Indian facilities must engage accredited verification bodies familiar with EU CBAM requirements and Indian steel industry practices. The verification process will examine data collection procedures, calculation methodologies, and supporting documentation for emission intensity determinations.

Financial impact assessments indicate potential CBAM costs of €15-45 per tonne for Indian steel exports, depending on emission intensity and EU ETS allowance prices. Facilities achieving emission intensities below 2.0 tCO₂/tonne through efficiency improvements and renewable energy adoption may gain competitive advantages in EU markets.

## Implementation Requirements and Documentation Standards

Facility-specific emission monitoring implementation requires comprehensive data collection systems covering all emission sources within defined system boundaries. Indian steel facilities must establish continuous monitoring for major emission sources, including coke consumption, limestone usage, natural gas consumption, and electricity consumption with hourly resolution capabilities.

Documentation requirements encompass production records, fuel consumption data, electricity invoices, laboratory analyses of input materials, and calibration certificates for monitoring equipment. The documentation must demonstrate traceability from raw material inputs through finished product output, enabling accurate emission allocation to specific product categories.

Quality management systems must comply with ISO 14064-1 standards for greenhouse gas quantification and reporting. Indian facilities require internal audit capabilities to verify data accuracy and calculation methodologies on quarterly basis. Staff training programs must cover emission calculation procedures, data collection protocols, and regulatory compliance requirements.

Digital reporting systems must interface with EU CBAM registry platforms, requiring standardized data formats and secure transmission capabilities. Indian facilities should implement enterprise resource planning integration to automate data collection and reduce manual reporting errors. The digital infrastructure must accommodate increasing data granularity requirements through the transitional period.
