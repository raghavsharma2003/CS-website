## Key Takeaways

Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) serve as critical documentation bridges between existing sustainability frameworks and EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) compliance requirements. Indian steel exporters must understand that while EPDs provide foundational carbon intensity data, direct alignment with CBAM's specific methodological requirements demands additional verification protocols and data granularity. The transitional period through December 2026 offers strategic opportunities to harmonize existing EPD frameworks with CBAM's embedded emissions calculation methodologies, potentially reducing compliance costs by up to 35% compared to developing entirely separate reporting systems.

## Understanding Environmental Product Declarations in CBAM Context

Environmental Product Declarations represent standardized, third-party verified documents that communicate quantified environmental information about products throughout their lifecycle. Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, these declarations assume heightened significance as potential data sources for CBAM embedded emissions calculations, though direct equivalency cannot be presumed without methodological verification.

EPDs typically follow ISO 14025 standards and utilize Product Category Rules (PCRs) that define calculation methodologies, system boundaries, and data quality requirements. For steel products, relevant PCRs include those developed by the International EPD System, SteelECO, and regional programs. However, CBAM's embedded emissions methodology operates under distinct parameters that may not align perfectly with traditional EPD scopes.

The fundamental challenge lies in temporal and geographical boundaries. EPDs often incorporate cradle-to-gate assessments covering raw material extraction through production facility gates, while CBAM focuses specifically on direct and indirect emissions from production processes within defined installation boundaries. This distinction creates potential gaps where EPD data may either over-capture or under-capture emissions relevant to CBAM calculations.

Steel-specific EPDs typically quantify emissions ranging from 1.8 to 2.4 tonnes CO2 equivalent per tonne of crude steel, depending on production routes and energy sources. These figures provide baseline references but require adjustment for CBAM's specific calculation boundaries and methodological requirements.

## CBAM Embedded Emissions Methodology Requirements

CBAM embedded emissions calculations follow prescribed methodologies outlined in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773, establishing specific parameters for data collection, verification, and reporting. The methodology distinguishes between default values and actual emissions, with strong preferences for installation-specific data over generic benchmarks.

Direct emissions encompass CO2 released from production processes, including process emissions from limestone decomposition in steel production and fuel combustion emissions from on-site energy generation. Indirect emissions cover electricity consumption, with emissions factors determined by the electricity grid mix of the country of origin. For Indian steel producers, this typically translates to emissions factors ranging from 0.82 to 0.91 kg CO2/kWh, depending on regional grid compositions.

The methodology requires emissions data at installation level, disaggregated by production routes and product categories. This granularity often exceeds EPD requirements, which may aggregate emissions across multiple installations or production campaigns. CBAM calculations must account for specific production periods, typically monthly reporting cycles, while EPDs often represent annual averages or representative production scenarios.

Verification requirements under CBAM demand independent third-party validation following EU ETS verification standards or equivalent frameworks. This standard may exceed typical EPD verification protocols, particularly regarding data uncertainty assessments and materiality thresholds.

## Data Alignment Challenges and Solutions

Primary alignment challenges emerge from methodological differences between EPD frameworks and CBAM requirements. EPDs typically employ lifecycle assessment methodologies following ISO 14040/14044 standards, while CBAM utilizes monitoring, reporting, and verification approaches aligned with EU ETS principles.

System boundary discrepancies represent the most significant alignment challenge. EPDs may include upstream emissions from raw material production, transportation, and waste management that fall outside CBAM's installation-specific boundaries. Conversely, CBAM requires specific treatment of electricity consumption and heat imports that may not be adequately captured in traditional EPD scopes.

Data quality requirements differ substantially between frameworks. EPDs accept various data sources including industry averages, literature values, and modeled data, provided they meet representativeness criteria. CBAM prioritizes measured data from continuous emissions monitoring systems, fuel consumption records, and electricity meter readings, with limited acceptance of estimated or modeled values.

Temporal alignment presents additional complexities. EPDs typically represent annual production averages or specific production campaigns, while CBAM requires monthly reporting with quarterly submissions. This temporal granularity demands more frequent data collection and verification cycles than traditional EPD programs.

Solutions involve developing hybrid documentation approaches that satisfy both EPD and CBAM requirements simultaneously. This includes implementing enhanced monitoring systems that capture CBAM-specific data points while maintaining EPD compliance, establishing verification protocols that meet both frameworks' requirements, and developing data management systems capable of disaggregating information according to different methodological needs.

## Verification and Documentation Standards

Verification standards for CBAM-aligned EPDs require enhanced protocols beyond traditional EPD verification procedures. The European Commission's implementing regulations specify verification criteria that align with EU ETS verification standards, demanding higher levels of data accuracy and uncertainty assessment than typical EPD programs.

Verification bodies must demonstrate competence in both lifecycle assessment methodologies and emissions monitoring protocols. This dual competency requirement limits the pool of qualified verifiers and may increase verification costs by 15-25% compared to standard EPD verification procedures.

Documentation requirements include detailed uncertainty assessments, materiality threshold determinations, and risk-based verification approaches. Verifiers must assess data quality indicators including temporal representativeness, geographical correlation, technological correlation, and completeness. These assessments must quantify uncertainty levels and demonstrate compliance with CBAM's data quality thresholds.

Record-keeping requirements extend beyond traditional EPD documentation to include detailed activity data, emissions factors, calculation methodologies, and quality assurance procedures. Documentation must be maintained for minimum five-year periods and made available to EU authorities upon request.

Third-party verification must occur annually for CBAM reporting, compared to typical EPD verification cycles of three to five years. This increased frequency demands enhanced internal quality management systems and more robust data collection procedures.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period concluding December 31, 2026, represents a critical window for Indian steel exporters to align EPD frameworks with CBAM requirements. During this period, reporting obligations focus on embedded emissions disclosure without financial obligations, providing opportunities to refine methodologies and documentation systems.

Regulatory developments expected during 2025-2026 include finalized technical guidance on verification procedures, clarified methodologies for complex steel products, and potential recognition frameworks for existing EPD programs that demonstrate CBAM compliance. The European Commission has indicated intentions to publish additional implementing acts addressing specific sectoral challenges and third-country verification arrangements.

Indian steel exporters should anticipate increased scrutiny of EPD methodologies and verification procedures as EU authorities develop enforcement capabilities. Early compliance with enhanced verification standards will provide competitive advantages when financial obligations commence January 1, 2027.

The period also offers opportunities for bilateral cooperation between Indian and EU authorities on mutual recognition of verification frameworks and technical capacity building. Such cooperation could reduce compliance costs and facilitate smoother market access for Indian steel products.

Industry associations and standard-setting bodies are expected to publish updated guidance during this period, potentially including revised PCRs that incorporate CBAM-specific requirements and harmonized verification protocols.

## Implementation Strategies for Indian Steel Exporters

Strategic implementation approaches should prioritize integration of CBAM requirements into existing EPD programs rather than developing parallel systems. This integration reduces administrative burden and leverages existing investments in sustainability documentation.

Phase one implementation involves gap analysis comparing current EPD methodologies with CBAM requirements, identifying data collection enhancements needed for compliance, and assessing verification procedure modifications. This analysis should quantify additional costs and timeline requirements for full compliance.

Phase two focuses on system modifications including enhanced monitoring equipment installation, data management system upgrades, and staff training on CBAM-specific requirements. Investment in automated data collection systems can reduce long-term compliance costs while improving data quality and reliability.

Phase three involves pilot testing of integrated EPD-CBAM documentation systems, conducting trial verifications under enhanced protocols, and refining procedures based on practical experience. Early engagement with qualified verification bodies can identify potential issues and optimize verification approaches.

Long-term strategies should consider potential expansion of CBAM to additional sectors and products, ensuring scalability of implemented systems. Investment in digital documentation platforms and automated reporting capabilities will provide competitive advantages as regulatory requirements evolve.
