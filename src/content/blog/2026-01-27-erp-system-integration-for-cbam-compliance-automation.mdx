The integration framework necessitates a multi-layered approach encompassing production data capture, carbon intensity calculations, and regulatory reporting automation.

Core system requirements include real-time production monitoring capabilities with granular tracking of raw material inputs, energy consumption patterns, and process-specific emission factors. The ERP architecture must support bidirectional data flows between manufacturing execution systems (MES) and carbon accounting modules, ensuring comprehensive coverage of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions across all production facilities.

Database schema modifications require dedicated tables for carbon intensity factors, emission source classifications, and temporal tracking of production batches. The system must maintain historical data integrity for minimum seven-year retention periods, supporting retrospective compliance audits and regulatory investigations.

Integration points must accommodate third-party carbon accounting software through standardized APIs, enabling seamless data exchange with specialized CBAM compliance platforms. The architecture should support multiple data formats including XML, JSON, and CSV for compatibility with various regulatory reporting systems.

## Data Mapping and Carbon Intensity Calculations

Accurate carbon intensity mapping within ERP systems requires systematic identification and classification of all emission-generating activities across steel production processes. The data architecture must capture direct emissions from combustion sources, process emissions from chemical reactions, and indirect emissions from electricity consumption with facility-specific emission factors.

Production data mapping encompasses raw material specifications including iron ore grade, coal composition, and limestone purity levels. Each input material requires associated carbon content factors and transportation emission calculations from point of origin to manufacturing facility. The system must track material flow through beneficiation, coking, sintering, and blast furnace operations with process-specific emission coefficients.

Energy consumption mapping requires integration with facility energy management systems, capturing electricity usage patterns, natural gas consumption, and steam generation data. The ERP system must apply regional grid emission factors for electricity consumption, updated quarterly to reflect seasonal variations and grid composition changes.

Process-specific calculations include carbon monoxide oxidation factors, limestone calcination emissions, and electrode consumption in electric arc furnace operations. The system must maintain separate calculation modules for different steel grades and production routes, ensuring accurate carbon intensity determination for each product category subject to CBAM regulations.

## API Integration with EU CBAM Registry

Technical integration with the European Union CBAM Registry requires robust API connectivity supporting secure data transmission and real-time synchronization capabilities. The integration framework must comply with EU data protection requirements while maintaining operational efficiency for high-volume transaction processing.

Authentication protocols utilize OAuth 2.0 framework with client credential flows, requiring secure token management and automatic refresh mechanisms. The API integration must support rate limiting compliance, typically restricted to 1,000 requests per hour during peak reporting periods, necessitating intelligent queuing and batch processing capabilities.

Data payload specifications require JSON formatting with mandatory fields including installation identifier, reporting period, production volumes, and calculated carbon intensities. The API must handle error responses gracefully, implementing retry logic for temporary service unavailability and validation failure scenarios.

Real-time data synchronization enables continuous compliance monitoring, automatically flagging discrepancies between ERP-calculated values and regulatory thresholds. The integration must support webhook notifications for critical compliance events, enabling immediate response to regulatory queries or audit requests.

## Automated Workflow Configuration

Compliance automation workflows within integrated ERP systems must accommodate the complex regulatory timeline requirements established under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, including transitional reporting obligations and full financial implementation phases.

Quarterly reporting workflows require automated data aggregation across multiple production facilities, consolidating carbon intensity calculations and production volumes for each CBAM-covered product category. The system must generate preliminary reports 30 days prior to submission deadlines, enabling quality assurance reviews and data validation processes.

Automated validation protocols include cross-referencing production data with energy consumption records, verifying material balance calculations, and confirming emission factor applications. The workflow must flag anomalies exceeding predefined tolerance thresholds, typically 5% variance from historical baselines, triggering manual review procedures.

Document generation automation produces standardized compliance reports in required regulatory formats, including detailed emission calculations, supporting documentation references, and authorized signatory attestations. The system must maintain version control for all generated documents, supporting audit trail requirements and regulatory inquiries.

## Data Validation and Quality Assurance Protocols

Comprehensive data validation protocols ensure compliance with stringent accuracy requirements imposed by CBAM regulations, minimizing regulatory penalties and audit findings. The validation framework encompasses automated consistency checks, statistical analysis, and manual verification procedures.

Primary validation rules include material balance verification, ensuring input quantities align with production outputs within acceptable tolerance ranges. Energy consumption validation compares actual usage against theoretical requirements based on production volumes and process specifications, identifying potential data collection errors or equipment malfunctions.

Carbon intensity validation protocols cross-reference calculated values against industry benchmarks and historical facility performance data. The system must identify outliers exceeding 10% deviation from expected ranges, triggering detailed investigation procedures and corrective action workflows.

Quality assurance procedures include monthly data reconciliation processes, comparing ERP-generated values with independent measurement systems and third-party verification results. The validation framework must support regulatory audit requirements, providing comprehensive documentation of data sources, calculation methodologies, and quality control measures.
