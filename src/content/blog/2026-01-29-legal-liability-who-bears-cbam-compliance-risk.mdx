- **Enforcement Timeline**: Full financial obligations commence January 1, 2026, following the current transitional reporting phase

## Primary Legal Framework and Liability Distribution

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism establishes a clear hierarchy of legal responsibility that fundamentally alters traditional trade relationships between Indian steel producers and European buyers. Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the primary legal obligation rests with the EU importer, who must surrender CBAM certificates corresponding to the carbon content of imported goods.

This regulatory structure creates a cascade of liability that extends beyond the immediate importer-exporter relationship. While Indian steel exporters do not face direct EU regulatory enforcement, they assume significant contractual and commercial risks that can result in market exclusion, financial penalties through supply agreements, and reputational damage within European markets.

The regulation specifically designates "authorized CBAM declarants" as the entities bearing direct compliance responsibility. These declarants, typically EU-based importers or their authorized representatives, must maintain comprehensive records, submit quarterly reports, and surrender certificates equivalent to the carbon intensity of imported steel products. Failure to comply results in penalties that can reach €50 per tonne of CO2 equivalent, creating substantial financial exposure that inevitably flows back to supply chain partners.

## Importer Obligations and Downstream Risk Transfer

EU importers operating under CBAM face multifaceted compliance obligations that directly impact their Indian steel suppliers. The regulation requires importers to obtain authorization from competent national authorities, maintain detailed records of carbon emissions associated with imported goods, and demonstrate compliance through certificate surrender mechanisms.

The authorization process itself creates barriers to entry, as importers must demonstrate technical competence, financial reliability, and operational capacity to manage CBAM compliance. This requirement effectively consolidates import activities among larger, more sophisticated trading entities, potentially reducing market access opportunities for smaller Indian steel exporters who previously relied on diverse buyer networks.

Importers typically transfer compliance risks to suppliers through contractual mechanisms, including carbon intensity warranties, indemnification clauses, and price adjustment formulas tied to CBAM certificate costs. These contractual structures shift practical compliance responsibility to Indian exporters while maintaining the legal framework that designates EU importers as primary obligated parties.

The quarterly reporting requirements impose additional operational burdens on importers, who must verify carbon intensity data provided by suppliers, maintain audit trails for emissions calculations, and submit detailed declarations to national authorities. This administrative complexity creates incentives for importers to consolidate their supplier base around partners capable of providing reliable, verified carbon data.

## Indian Exporter Exposure and Contractual Risk

Indian steel exporters face substantial indirect liability through contractual relationships with EU buyers, despite not being directly subject to EU regulatory enforcement. This exposure manifests through several interconnected risk vectors that can significantly impact business operations and profitability.

Supply agreements increasingly incorporate carbon intensity specifications, with buyers demanding detailed emissions data, third-party verification, and ongoing monitoring capabilities. Exporters unable to provide accurate, verified carbon data face contract termination, price penalties, or exclusion from tender processes. The technical requirements for carbon accounting often exceed the current capabilities of smaller Indian steel producers, creating competitive disadvantages within European markets.

Warranty and indemnification clauses represent another significant source of liability exposure. EU importers routinely require suppliers to warrant the accuracy of carbon intensity data and indemnify against penalties resulting from data inaccuracies or non-compliance. These contractual provisions can expose Indian exporters to financial liability equivalent to the full CBAM penalty structure, effectively transferring regulatory risk across international boundaries.

Price adjustment mechanisms tied to CBAM certificate costs create ongoing financial exposure for Indian exporters. As carbon prices fluctuate within EU emissions trading systems, the cost of CBAM certificates varies accordingly. Supply agreements often include provisions allowing buyers to adjust purchase prices based on actual certificate costs, transferring carbon price volatility risk to suppliers.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transition from the current reporting-only phase to full financial obligations on January 1, 2026, represents a critical inflection point for Indian steel exporters. During 2025, companies must complete comprehensive preparation activities including carbon accounting system implementation, third-party verification arrangements, and supply chain documentation upgrades.

The European Commission estimates that approximately 2.3 million tonnes of Indian steel products will be subject to CBAM obligations annually, representing significant market exposure for the Indian steel industry. Companies failing to achieve compliance readiness by the January 2026 deadline face immediate market access restrictions and potential contract cancellations from EU buyers.

Enforcement mechanisms will become fully operational in 2026, with national competent authorities conducting regular audits, imposing penalties for non-compliance, and maintaining databases of authorized importers and their suppliers. The regulatory framework includes provisions for market surveillance, customs cooperation, and information sharing between member states, creating comprehensive enforcement coverage across EU markets.

Indian exporters must anticipate increased due diligence requirements from EU buyers during 2025, as importers seek to minimize their own compliance risks. This due diligence process will likely include on-site audits, carbon accounting system reviews, and ongoing monitoring arrangements that require significant resource commitments from Indian steel producers.

## Enforcement Mechanisms and Penalty Structures

The CBAM enforcement framework operates through national competent authorities in each EU member state, creating multiple potential enforcement touchpoints for Indian steel exporters operating across different European markets. These authorities possess broad investigative powers, including the ability to conduct audits, request documentation, and impose penalties for non-compliance.

Penalty calculations under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 are based on the carbon content of non-compliant imports, with financial penalties reaching €50 per tonne of CO2 equivalent. For typical Indian steel products with carbon intensities ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 tonnes CO2 per tonne of steel, this penalty structure can result in charges of €100 to €125 per tonne of steel product, representing substantial financial exposure.

Beyond direct financial penalties, enforcement mechanisms include market access restrictions, importer authorization revocation, and customs detention of non-compliant shipments. These administrative penalties can effectively exclude Indian exporters from EU markets, regardless of their ability to pay financial penalties.

The regulation establishes appeal procedures and administrative review processes, but these mechanisms operate under EU administrative law principles that may be unfamiliar to Indian exporters. Companies facing enforcement actions must navigate complex procedural requirements while managing ongoing commercial relationships with EU buyers.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies and Compliance Frameworks

Effective CBAM compliance requires Indian steel exporters to implement comprehensive risk management frameworks addressing both direct operational risks and indirect contractual exposures. These frameworks must integrate carbon accounting systems, supply chain monitoring, and contractual risk management into coherent operational strategies.

Carbon accounting system implementation represents the foundational element of CBAM compliance. Indian exporters must establish monitoring, reporting, and verification systems capable of producing accurate, auditable carbon intensity data for all steel products exported to EU markets. This requirement often necessitates significant capital investments in monitoring equipment, data management systems, and staff training programs.

Third-party verification arrangements provide essential credibility for carbon intensity claims while transferring some liability risk to qualified verification bodies. Indian exporters should engage accredited verification organizations capable of providing services recognized by EU competent authorities, ensuring that verification reports meet regulatory standards and buyer requirements.

Contractual risk management strategies should address carbon intensity warranties, indemnification exposures, and price adjustment mechanisms through careful negotiation and legal review. Indian exporters may benefit from engaging legal counsel experienced in EU environmental regulations and international trade law to structure appropriate risk allocation arrangements with EU buyers.
