## Understanding CBAM Scope for Steel Fasteners

Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, steel fasteners are classified as "aggregated goods" containing steel as a precursor material. The regulation's Annex I specifically includes iron and steel products under CN codes beginning with 72 and 73, encompassing most industrial fasteners manufactured in Indian facilities.

The critical distinction lies in understanding that fasteners are not simple goods but aggregated products. This classification triggers specific reporting obligations where the embedded emissions must account for both the steel precursor production and the fastener manufacturing process itself.

Indian manufacturers must recognize that CBAM treats each installation separately. A single manufacturing facility producing multiple fastener types may require different emission calculations for each product line, depending on the specific steel grades and manufacturing processes employed.

### Primary CN Code Categories

Steel fasteners typically fall within these CN code ranges:

- **7318.11**: Coach screws of iron or steel
- **7318.12**: Wood screws of iron or steel  
- **7318.13**: Screw hooks and screw rings of iron or steel
- **7318.14**: Self-tapping screws of iron or steel
- **7318.15**: Other screws and bolts with nuts or washers
- **7318.16**: Nuts of iron or steel
- **7318.19**: Threaded articles not elsewhere specified

Each code carries distinct emission calculation requirements and default values when actual data is unavailable.

## Technical Classification Requirements

Proper HS code mapping requires understanding the technical specifications that differentiate fastener categories under CBAM. The regulation does not simply rely on commercial descriptions but demands precise technical classification based on manufacturing processes and material composition.

### Material Composition Thresholds

For steel fasteners, the carbon content and alloy composition directly impact both HS code classification and embedded emissions calculations. Fasteners manufactured from:

- **Carbon steel**: Standard emission factors apply based on steel grade
- **Alloy steel**: Higher emission factors due to additional processing requirements  
- **Stainless steel**: Separate calculation methodology for chromium and nickel content
- **Coated fasteners**: Additional emissions from coating processes must be included

Indian manufacturers must maintain detailed material certificates from their steel suppliers to ensure accurate classification. The precursor steel's production method (basic oxygen furnace, electric arc furnace, or induction melting) significantly affects the embedded emissions calculation.

### Manufacturing Process Impact

The fastener manufacturing process itself contributes to embedded emissions beyond the steel precursor. Key processes affecting classification include:

- **Cold forming operations**: Energy consumption and process emissions
- **Heat treatment**: Fuel consumption and direct process emissions
- **Threading operations**: Additional energy requirements
- **Surface treatment**: Coating, plating, or galvanizing emissions

CBAM requires actual data from these processes rather than industry averages. CarbonSettle's forensic data extraction capabilities can systematically capture this operational data from existing manufacturing systems.

## Mapping Steel Precursor Requirements

Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, aggregated goods like fasteners must report embedded emissions from their steel precursors separately from the manufacturing process emissions. This dual reporting requirement creates complexity in HS code mapping.

### Precursor Steel Classification

The steel used in fastener production must be classified according to its own CN code before calculating the fastener's final classification. Common precursor categories include:

- **7213**: Bars and rods of iron or non-alloy steel
- **7214**: Bars and rods of stainless steel or other alloy steel  
- **7215**: Wire of iron or non-alloy steel
- **7221**: Bars and rods of stainless steel
- **7227**: Bars and rods of other alloy steel

Each precursor category carries different default emission factors. Indian manufacturers sourcing steel from multiple suppliers must maintain detailed records of the CN code classification for each steel batch used in production.

### Installation-Specific Calculations

CBAM treats each manufacturing installation as a separate reporting entity. For Indian fastener manufacturers operating multiple production lines or facilities, this requires:

- **Separate emission calculations** for each installation
- **Individual CN code mapping** for products from each facility
- **Distinct precursor tracking** by installation location
- **Installation-specific default values** when actual data is unavailable

The regulation explicitly prohibits averaging emissions across installations, even within the same company. Each facility must maintain independent records and calculations.

## Default Values vs. Actual Data Requirements

Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes a clear hierarchy favoring actual production data over default emission factors. For Indian steel fastener manufacturers, this distinction is crucial for cost management and regulatory compliance.

### Default Emission Factors

When actual data is unavailable, CBAM applies default emission factors that are typically higher than industry averages. For steel fasteners, default values consider:

- **Steel precursor emissions**: Based on worst-case production scenarios
- **Manufacturing process emissions**: Conservative estimates for energy consumption
- **Additional processing**: Default values for heat treatment and surface finishing

These default factors are intentionally punitive to encourage actual data reporting. Indian manufacturers relying on defaults face significantly higher CBAM certificate costs compared to those providing forensic production data.

### Actual Data Advantages

Manufacturers providing actual production data typically achieve 15-30% lower embedded emissions calculations compared to default values. Actual data requirements include:

- **Direct emissions**: Fuel combustion and process emissions from fastener production
- **Indirect emissions**: Electricity consumption with appropriate emission factors
- **Precursor emissions**: Actual data from steel suppliers or their default values
- **Installation boundaries**: Clear definition of what processes are included

CarbonSettle's forensic data extraction methodology systematically captures this actual data from existing plant systems, ensuring compliance while minimizing CBAM certificate costs.

## XML Generation and Reporting Protocols

CBAM reporting requires specific XML file formats containing detailed embedded emissions data for each fastener shipment. The technical requirements for XML generation are precise and must align with the European Commission's technical specifications.

### Required Data Elements

Each CBAM report must include:

- **CN code classification** with 8-digit precision
- **Embedded emissions** in tonnes CO2 equivalent per tonne of product
- **Production installation** identification and location
- **Precursor emissions** separately reported
- **Calculation methodology** documentation

The XML structure must validate against the official schema provided by the European Commission. Errors in format or missing data elements result in automatic rejection of CBAM declarations.

### Installation Reporting Requirements

For each manufacturing installation, the XML file must specify:

- **Installation identifier**: Unique code for each production facility
- **Geographic coordinates**: Precise location data
- **Production capacity**: Annual capacity for each fastener type
- **Monitoring methodology**: How emissions data was collected and verified

Indian manufacturers operating multiple installations must generate separate XML sections for each facility, even when producing identical fastener types.

### Quality Assurance Protocols

Before submission, XML files require technical validation including:

- **Schema compliance**: Validation against official EU technical specifications
- **Data consistency**: Cross-checking embedded emissions calculations
- **Installation verification**: Confirming installation data matches official records
- **Precursor alignment**: Ensuring steel precursor data is properly linked

CarbonSettle's XML generation capabilities include automated validation protocols that identify and correct common formatting errors before submission to EU authorities.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use the same HS code for fasteners made from different steel grades?

**A:** No. Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, fasteners manufactured from different steel grades require separate CN code classifications even if they serve similar functions. Carbon steel, alloy steel, and stainless steel fasteners each have distinct embedded emissions profiles and must be classified accordingly. The steel precursor's composition directly affects both the HS code and the embedded emissions calculation. Indian manufacturers must maintain detailed material certificates for each steel grade used and apply the appropriate CN code classification for each product variant.

### Q: How do I handle fasteners that undergo multiple manufacturing processes across different installations?

**A:** CBAM requires reporting based on the installation where the final fastener manufacturing occurs, but you must account for embedded emissions from all previous processing stages. If your fastener undergoes initial forming at one installation and final threading/heat treatment at another, the final installation reports the total embedded emissions including precursor steel and all intermediate processing. You must maintain detailed transfer documentation showing the embedded emissions at each stage. Each installation in the chain must provide emission data for their specific processes, which accumulates in the final product's embedded emissions calculation.

### Q: What happens if my steel supplier cannot provide actual emission data for the precursor material?

**A:** When steel suppliers cannot provide actual emission data, you must use the default emission factors specified in CBAM's implementing regulations for the appropriate steel precursor CN code. These default values are typically 20-40% higher than actual industry averages, significantly increasing your CBAM certificate costs. You should work with suppliers to implement emission monitoring systems or consider sourcing from suppliers who can provide actual data. CarbonSettle's forensic data extraction methodology can help both you and your suppliers establish the monitoring systems needed to capture actual emission data, reducing reliance on punitive default values in future reporting periods.
