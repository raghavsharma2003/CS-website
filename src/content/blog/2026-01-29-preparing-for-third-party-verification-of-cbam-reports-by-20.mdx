## Understanding Third-Party Verification Requirements Under CBAM

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) transitional phase concludes on December 31, 2025, marking the beginning of mandatory financial obligations and third-party verification requirements. Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes that from January 1, 2026, all CBAM declarations must undergo independent verification by accredited third-party bodies before submission to EU authorities.

For Indian steel exporters, this represents a fundamental shift from self-reported emissions data to externally validated carbon accounting. The verification process encompasses embedded carbon calculations, production methodologies, and supporting documentation systems. Steel manufacturers must demonstrate compliance with EU monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) standards equivalent to those applied within the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS).

Third-party verifiers assess the accuracy, completeness, and consistency of reported emissions data against established methodologies. This includes verification of direct emissions from steel production processes, indirect emissions from electricity consumption, and any upstream emissions from raw materials where applicable. The verification scope extends to data collection systems, calculation methodologies, and internal quality assurance procedures.

## Establishing Verifiable Carbon Accounting Systems

Steel exporters must implement robust carbon accounting frameworks capable of withstanding independent scrutiny. The foundation of verifiable systems lies in comprehensive data collection protocols that capture all emission sources within the production boundary. This includes blast furnace operations, basic oxygen furnace processes, electric arc furnace activities, and auxiliary equipment operations.

Documentation requirements mandate maintaining detailed records of fuel consumption, electricity usage, raw material inputs, and production outputs. Each data point must be traceable to source documents such as utility bills, fuel delivery receipts, and production logs. The accounting system must demonstrate clear linkages between input materials, energy consumption, and finished steel products.

Emission factor selection requires particular attention, as verifiers will scrutinize the appropriateness and accuracy of applied factors. Default emission factors from IPCC guidelines may be acceptable for certain applications, but facility-specific factors derived from direct measurement or supplier-specific data typically receive higher verification confidence ratings. Steel producers should prioritize obtaining supplier-specific emission factors for key inputs such as iron ore, coking coal, and limestone.

Internal quality assurance procedures must include regular data validation checks, reconciliation of mass and energy balances, and periodic internal audits of the carbon accounting system. These procedures should be documented in standard operating procedures and demonstrate consistent application across reporting periods.

## Selecting and Working with Accredited Verifiers

The selection of appropriate third-party verifiers represents a critical decision affecting both compliance outcomes and operational efficiency. Verifiers must hold accreditation under ISO 14065 standards and demonstrate specific competence in steel sector carbon accounting. The European Commission maintains a database of approved verification bodies, though additional national accreditation schemes may apply.

Steel exporters should evaluate potential verifiers based on sector expertise, geographic presence, and previous experience with CBAM-related verification activities. Verifiers with established relationships within the Indian steel industry may offer advantages in terms of understanding local production practices and regulatory contexts.

The verification engagement should commence well before mandatory deadlines to allow sufficient time for data review, site visits, and resolution of any identified issues. Initial engagement discussions should establish clear scope boundaries, verification methodologies, and reporting timelines. Steel producers should expect verifiers to conduct detailed reviews of carbon accounting procedures, data management systems, and supporting documentation.

Communication protocols between steel producers and verifiers must facilitate efficient information exchange while maintaining audit independence. Regular progress meetings, document sharing platforms, and designated points of contact help ensure verification activities proceed according to schedule without disrupting production operations.

## Documentation and Data Management Requirements

Third-party verification demands comprehensive documentation systems that provide clear audit trails for all reported emissions data. Steel exporters must maintain records demonstrating the completeness and accuracy of carbon accounting calculations over the entire reporting period, typically spanning 12 months of production data.

Primary documentation includes production records showing steel output quantities, grades, and specifications. Energy consumption records must detail fuel usage by type and source, electricity consumption from grid and on-site generation, and any steam or heat purchases from external sources. Raw material documentation should capture quantities, compositions, and supplier information for all major inputs including iron ore, coal, limestone, and ferroalloys.

Supporting documentation encompasses calibration certificates for measurement equipment, laboratory analysis reports for fuel and material compositions, and maintenance records for emission monitoring systems. Quality assurance documentation should demonstrate regular validation of data collection procedures and periodic reconciliation of reported values against independent sources.

Data management systems must provide secure storage, version control, and access logging for all verification-related documentation. Electronic systems should include backup procedures and data integrity controls to prevent unauthorized modifications. Physical documents require organized filing systems with clear indexing and retrieval procedures.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transition from voluntary reporting to mandatory verification represents the most significant regulatory milestone in CBAM implementation. Steel exporters face immediate operational impacts as verification requirements take effect January 1, 2026, with the first verified declarations due by May 31, 2026, covering the initial quarter of mandatory CBAM operations.

Financial implications extend beyond direct verification costs to include potential CBAM certificate purchase obligations. Steel exporters unable to demonstrate compliance with verification requirements may face restricted market access or additional financial penalties. The European Commission estimates that unverified emissions may result in default emission values 20-30% higher than facility-specific calculations, directly impacting CBAM certificate requirements.

Regulatory enforcement mechanisms include enhanced scrutiny of verification reports, potential suspension of CBAM authorizations for non-compliant exporters, and coordination between EU member state authorities and third-country regulators. Indian steel exporters should anticipate increased regulatory attention from both EU and domestic authorities as CBAM enforcement mechanisms mature.

Supply chain impacts may emerge as EU importers increasingly require verified emissions data as a condition of purchase contracts. Steel exporters with robust verification systems may gain competitive advantages in EU markets, while those struggling with compliance may face market access restrictions or pricing disadvantages.

## Implementation Timeline and Milestones

Steel exporters must establish clear implementation timelines to ensure readiness for mandatory verification requirements. The critical path begins with carbon accounting system development, progressing through verifier selection, pilot verification exercises, and full-scale implementation.

Initial preparation phases should commence by Q2 2025 to allow sufficient time for system development and testing. Carbon accounting system implementation requires 4-6 months for comprehensive deployment, including staff training, procedure development, and data collection system establishment. This phase should conclude by Q3 2025 to provide adequate operational experience before verification activities begin.

Verifier selection and engagement should occur during Q3 2025, allowing time for proposal evaluation, contract negotiation, and preliminary system reviews. Early engagement enables verifiers to provide guidance on system design and documentation requirements before full-scale verification activities commence.

Pilot verification exercises during Q4 2025 provide opportunities to identify and resolve potential issues before mandatory deadlines. These exercises should encompass complete verification procedures using actual production data from a representative period. Results inform final system adjustments and staff training requirements.

Full-scale verification activities begin January 2026, with ongoing data collection, periodic verifier reviews, and preparation of verification reports for submission deadlines. Steel exporters should maintain continuous verification readiness rather than treating verification as an annual event.
