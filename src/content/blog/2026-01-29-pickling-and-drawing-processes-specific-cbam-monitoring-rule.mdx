## Understanding CBAM Requirements for Pickling Operations

Steel pickling processes involve the removal of oxide scales and surface impurities through chemical treatment, primarily using hydrochloric or sulfuric acid solutions. Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, these operations fall within the scope of CBAM monitoring as they constitute integral steps in steel production chains subject to carbon border adjustments.

The regulatory framework mandates that installations engaged in pickling activities establish comprehensive monitoring protocols that capture both direct process emissions and indirect emissions from electricity consumption. Direct emissions primarily originate from the decomposition of pickling acids, neutralization processes, and waste treatment operations. The chemical reactions involved in oxide removal generate measurable CO2 emissions that must be quantified using approved methodologies.

Installation operators must implement continuous monitoring systems capable of tracking acid consumption rates, neutralization agent usage, and waste stream compositions. The monitoring boundary extends beyond the pickling tanks themselves to encompass associated equipment including acid regeneration units, neutralization systems, and waste water treatment facilities. This holistic approach ensures complete capture of process-related emissions.

Specific attention must be paid to the treatment of pickling sludge and spent acid solutions, as these waste streams often undergo thermal treatment or chemical neutralization processes that generate additional CO2 emissions. The regulatory framework requires these secondary emissions to be allocated to the primary steel products based on mass or economic value allocation methodologies approved under the EU ETS framework.

## Drawing Process Emission Calculations

Cold drawing operations transform hot-rolled steel products into precise dimensional specifications through mechanical deformation processes. These operations generate carbon emissions through several pathways that require systematic monitoring under CBAM regulations. The primary emission sources include electricity consumption for drawing equipment, lubricant application and removal processes, and thermal treatment of drawn products.

Drawing lubricants, typically soap-based or synthetic compounds, undergo thermal decomposition during the drawing process, releasing CO2 and other greenhouse gases. The emission factor for lubricant decomposition ranges from 2.1 to 2.8 kg CO2 per kilogram of lubricant consumed, depending on the specific chemical composition and operating temperatures. Installation operators must maintain detailed records of lubricant consumption rates and composition data to support accurate emission calculations.

The mechanical energy required for cold drawing operations translates to indirect emissions through electricity consumption. Drawing mills typically consume 45-65 kWh per tonne of processed steel, with higher consumption rates for products requiring multiple drawing passes or specialized surface treatments. The carbon intensity of consumed electricity must be determined using either supplier-specific emission factors or national grid emission factors as specified in the CBAM implementing regulation.

Heat treatment processes following drawing operations, including stress relief annealing and surface hardening treatments, generate additional direct emissions from fuel combustion. Natural gas consumption for these thermal processes typically ranges from 0.8 to 1.2 GJ per tonne of treated steel, corresponding to emission factors of 56.1 kg CO2 per GJ for natural gas combustion. These emissions must be allocated to specific product categories based on production volumes and treatment requirements.

## Installation-Level Monitoring Protocols

CBAM compliance requires the establishment of installation-level monitoring systems that capture emissions from all relevant processes within defined system boundaries. For facilities conducting both pickling and drawing operations, the monitoring system must differentiate between emissions attributable to each process while maintaining overall installation-level emission inventories.

The monitoring protocol must incorporate measurement, calculation, and estimation methodologies aligned with EU ETS monitoring and reporting guidelines. Direct emissions from fuel combustion require continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) or periodic sampling protocols depending on installation capacity and emission levels. Installations with annual CO2 emissions exceeding 25,000 tonnes must implement CEMS for major emission sources.

Process-specific monitoring points must be established at critical locations including acid storage and handling areas, drawing mill stations, heat treatment furnaces, and waste treatment facilities. Each monitoring point requires calibrated instrumentation capable of measuring relevant parameters including flow rates, concentrations, temperatures, and pressures with specified accuracy requirements.

Data quality assurance protocols must ensure measurement uncertainties remain within acceptable limits as defined in the monitoring plan. For pickling operations, acid consumption measurements must achieve accuracy levels of ±2.5%, while drawing process electricity consumption monitoring must maintain ±1.5% accuracy. These requirements necessitate regular calibration of monitoring equipment and implementation of quality control procedures.

Installation operators must maintain comprehensive documentation supporting all emission calculations, including supplier certificates for purchased materials, laboratory analysis results for process inputs and outputs, and calibration records for monitoring equipment. This documentation must be retained for a minimum of five years and made available for verification activities conducted by accredited verification bodies.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period for CBAM implementation extends through December 2025, during which installations must submit quarterly reports containing detailed emission data without financial obligations. Starting January 2026, the definitive CBAM system becomes operational, requiring the surrender of CBAM certificates corresponding to embedded carbon content in imported goods.

For Indian steel exporters engaged in pickling and drawing operations, the 2025-2026 transition period represents a critical window for system implementation and process optimization. Installations must complete the development and approval of monitoring plans by March 2025 to ensure adequate data collection periods for baseline establishment. The monitoring plan approval process typically requires 3-4 months, including technical review and potential revision cycles.

The European Commission has indicated that enforcement activities will intensify during 2025, with increased scrutiny of monitoring plan adequacy and data quality. Installations demonstrating non-compliance with monitoring requirements may face provisional measures including increased certificate surrender obligations or temporary import restrictions. These enforcement mechanisms underscore the importance of proactive compliance preparation.

Financial implications become significant starting 2026, with CBAM certificate prices expected to track EU ETS allowance prices. Current projections suggest certificate prices in the range of €80-120 per tonne CO2 during the initial implementation period. For steel products with embedded emissions of 2.5-3.0 tCO2 per tonne, this translates to additional costs of €200-360 per tonne of exported steel products.

The regulatory framework includes provisions for carbon leakage protection measures that may affect Indian exporters differently based on domestic carbon pricing mechanisms. Installations subject to carbon pricing systems deemed equivalent to EU ETS may claim deductions from CBAM obligations, potentially reducing financial exposure by 40-60% depending on domestic carbon price levels.

## Verification and Compliance Requirements

CBAM compliance requires independent verification of emission reports by accredited verification bodies recognized under EU ETS frameworks. The verification process encompasses review of monitoring plan implementation, assessment of data quality and completeness, and validation of emission calculations and allocation methodologies.

Verification activities must be conducted annually for installations with emissions exceeding 10,000 tonnes CO2 per year, while smaller installations may qualify for simplified verification procedures or extended verification cycles. The verification scope includes on-site inspections of monitoring equipment, review of calibration records, and assessment of data management systems and quality assurance procedures.

Verifiers must possess specific technical competencies related to steel production processes, including detailed understanding of pickling chemistry, drawing mechanics, and associated emission sources. The accreditation requirements for CBAM verifiers include demonstrated experience with steel sector emission monitoring and familiarity with relevant technical standards and calculation methodologies.

Non-conformities identified during verification activities must be addressed through corrective action plans developed in consultation with the verification body. Material misstatements in emission reports may result in qualified or adverse verification opinions, potentially triggering enforcement actions by competent authorities in EU member states.

The verification process includes assessment of uncertainty levels in emission calculations, with particular attention to measurement accuracy, sampling representativeness, and allocation methodology appropriateness. Installations must demonstrate that overall uncertainty levels remain within acceptable limits as specified in approved monitoring plans, typically requiring combined uncertainties below 5% for major emission sources.

## Implementation Strategies for Indian Exporters

Indian steel producers engaged in pickling and drawing operations must develop comprehensive implementation strategies addressing both technical and commercial aspects of CBAM compliance. The strategy development process should commence with detailed assessment of current monitoring capabilities and identification of system enhancement requirements.

Technical implementation requires investment in monitoring infrastructure, including installation of measurement equipment, development of data management systems, and establishment of quality assurance procedures. The capital investment for comprehensive monitoring systems typically ranges from €150,000 to €500,000 per installation, depending on facility size and complexity.

Commercial strategies must address the financial impact of CBAM certificate costs on export competitiveness. Options include product portfolio optimization toward lower-carbon intensive grades, investment in emission reduction technologies, and development of carbon-neutral product offerings supported by renewable energy procurement or carbon offset mechanisms.

Supply chain integration represents a critical success factor, requiring coordination with raw material suppliers, energy providers, and logistics partners to ensure comprehensive emission data availability. This coordination extends to development of supplier-specific emission factors and establishment of data sharing protocols that support accurate emission calculations.

Training and capacity building initiatives must ensure that operational personnel possess necessary competencies for monitoring system operation and data quality management. The training program should encompass technical aspects of emission monitoring, regulatory requirements interpretation, and data management system operation.
