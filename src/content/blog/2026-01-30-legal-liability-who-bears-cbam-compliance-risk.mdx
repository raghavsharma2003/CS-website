## Key Takeaways

- **Primary liability rests with EU importers** under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, creating downstream accountability for upstream emissions data
- **Indian steel exporters face indirect liability** through contractual obligations and market access restrictions
- **Data verification failures** can trigger penalties up to €50 per tonne of CO2 equivalent for non-compliant CBAM certificates
- **Joint liability mechanisms** emerge through supply chain agreements, shifting traditional risk allocation models
- **Insurance coverage gaps** exist for CBAM-specific compliance failures, requiring specialized risk management strategies

## Legal Framework and Primary Liability Assignment

Under Regulation (EU) 2023/956, the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism establishes a clear hierarchy of legal responsibility that fundamentally alters traditional trade liability structures. The regulation designates **EU importers as primary obligated parties**, creating a downstream accountability model where the entity physically bringing goods into the EU customs territory bears ultimate compliance responsibility.

This liability structure operates through the CBAM certificate system, where importers must surrender certificates corresponding to the carbon content of imported goods. The regulation explicitly states that "the CBAM declarant shall be liable for the surrender of CBAM certificates" covering embedded emissions in imported products. For Indian steel exporters, this creates an indirect but significant liability exposure through contractual relationships and market access dependencies.

The enforcement mechanism operates through national competent authorities in each EU member state, with penalties varying by jurisdiction but typically ranging from administrative fines to import restrictions. Germany's implementation, for example, establishes penalties of up to €50 per tonne of CO2 equivalent for certificate shortfalls, while France applies progressive penalty structures based on violation severity.

## Upstream Supplier Obligations and Data Liability

Indian steel exporters, while not directly liable under EU law, face substantial **data provision obligations** that create enforceable liability through commercial relationships. The regulation requires importers to obtain "actual embedded emissions" data from producers, establishing a mandatory information flow that transforms traditional supplier-buyer dynamics.

Steel producers must provide verified emissions data covering direct emissions (Scope 1), indirect emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 2), and specific upstream emissions from precursor materials. Failure to provide accurate, verifiable data creates contractual liability exposure and potential market exclusion. The verification requirements demand third-party auditing by accredited bodies, adding layers of professional liability for both producers and verification entities.

The temporal aspect of data liability extends beyond individual transactions. Under the regulation's transitional provisions, emissions data must be maintained for audit purposes for a minimum of four years, creating ongoing documentation obligations. Indian exporters face potential retrospective liability if data accuracy issues emerge during EU customs audits or competent authority investigations.

## Contractual Risk Allocation Mechanisms

Commercial contracts between Indian steel exporters and EU importers increasingly incorporate **CBAM-specific liability allocation clauses** that redistribute regulatory compliance risks. These contractual mechanisms typically include:

**Indemnification provisions** where exporters assume liability for emissions data accuracy and regulatory compliance costs. Standard clauses require Indian producers to indemnify EU buyers against CBAM penalties resulting from data deficiencies or verification failures.

**Price adjustment mechanisms** that automatically transfer CBAM certificate costs to exporters through pricing formulas. These clauses effectively shift the economic burden of carbon pricing upstream while maintaining legal liability with importers.

**Termination rights** allowing EU importers to cancel contracts if exporters fail to meet CBAM data requirements or verification standards. These provisions create market access liability for Indian producers, potentially more severe than direct financial penalties.

**Performance guarantees** requiring exporters to provide financial security for CBAM compliance obligations. Bank guarantees or insurance policies secure importer obligations while creating direct financial exposure for Indian steel producers.

## Insurance and Financial Risk Management

Traditional trade credit insurance policies typically exclude CBAM-related losses, creating **coverage gaps** that require specialized risk management approaches. Standard marine cargo policies, commercial general liability coverage, and professional indemnity insurance do not address CBAM compliance failures or associated penalties.

Emerging insurance products specifically designed for carbon border adjustment risks include:

**CBAM compliance insurance** covering penalties and additional costs resulting from emissions data errors or verification failures. These policies typically require extensive due diligence and ongoing monitoring of production processes and data management systems.

**Supply chain carbon liability coverage** protecting against upstream emissions data deficiencies that trigger downstream compliance failures. Coverage extends to third-party verification costs and regulatory defense expenses.

**Business interruption insurance** for CBAM-related market access restrictions. Policies cover lost profits and additional expenses when EU market access is suspended due to compliance failures.

Premium calculations for CBAM-specific coverage consider production process carbon intensity, data management system reliability, and verification body accreditation status. Indian steel exporters with integrated carbon management systems and established verification relationships typically qualify for preferred pricing structures.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transition from CBAM's reporting-only phase to full financial implementation in 2026 fundamentally alters liability exposure profiles for Indian steel exporters. During 2025, the final year of transitional arrangements, regulatory authorities will conduct comprehensive audits of reported emissions data, establishing precedents for enforcement approaches and penalty applications.

**Audit intensification** during 2025 will focus on data verification accuracy and supply chain traceability. EU competent authorities are developing standardized audit protocols that will be applied retroactively to transitional period data, creating potential liability for current reporting deficiencies.

**Penalty calibration** mechanisms are being finalized by member states, with most jurisdictions adopting progressive structures that escalate based on violation frequency and materiality. The European Commission's guidance indicates penalties will initially focus on systematic non-compliance rather than isolated data errors.

**Market access restrictions** beyond financial penalties are being developed for persistent non-compliance. These mechanisms could include temporary import suspensions or enhanced scrutiny requirements that effectively increase transaction costs and processing delays.

## Enforcement Mechanisms and Penalty Structures

EU member states are implementing diverse enforcement approaches that create varying liability exposures depending on import destination. **Germany's Federal Office for Economic Affairs and Export Control (BAFA)** has established the most comprehensive enforcement framework, with dedicated CBAM compliance units and standardized audit procedures.

The enforcement process typically follows a three-tier structure:

**Administrative review** of CBAM declarations and supporting documentation, conducted through automated systems that flag statistical anomalies or data inconsistencies. This initial screening identifies cases requiring detailed investigation.

**Detailed audit** involving on-site inspections of EU importer facilities and document review extending to upstream suppliers. These audits can trigger requests for additional documentation from Indian steel producers and their verification bodies.

**Penalty assessment** based on violation materiality and compliance history. First-time violations typically receive administrative warnings or minimal fines, while systematic non-compliance triggers maximum penalty structures.

Cross-border enforcement cooperation between EU authorities and Indian regulatory bodies is being developed through bilateral agreements that could extend enforcement jurisdiction to Indian facilities. These arrangements create potential direct liability exposure for Indian exporters under EU regulatory authority.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can Indian steel exporters be directly prosecuted under EU CBAM regulations?**
A: No, Indian exporters cannot be directly prosecuted under EU law. However, they face indirect liability through contractual obligations with EU importers and potential market access restrictions for non-compliance with data provision requirements.

**Q: What happens if emissions data provided by Indian exporters is later found to be inaccurate?**
A: Inaccurate data can trigger penalties against EU importers, who typically seek contractual remedies against Indian suppliers. This can include financial indemnification, contract termination, or legal action under applicable commercial law.

**Q: Are there insurance products specifically covering CBAM compliance risks?**
A: Yes, specialized CBAM compliance insurance is emerging, covering penalties, verification costs, and business interruption from market access restrictions. However, coverage is limited and requires extensive due diligence of carbon management systems.

**Q: How long must Indian exporters maintain CBAM-related documentation?**
A: Documentation must be maintained for at least four years from the date of import declaration. This includes emissions data, verification reports, and supporting production records.

**Q: Can CBAM liability be completely transferred to Indian exporters through contracts?**
A: While economic burden can be shifted through pricing and indemnification clauses, primary legal liability under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 remains with EU importers. Complete liability transfer is not possible under the current regulatory framework.
