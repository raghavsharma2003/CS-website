## Key Takeaways

- Quarterly CBAM reports must be submitted by the last day of the month following each quarter under Regulation (EU) 2023/956
- Compliance officers must aggregate embedded emissions data across all installations and precursors for each CN Code
- Late or incomplete submissions trigger enforcement actions by Member State competent authorities
- Actual production data supersedes default values in all quarterly calculations
- Installation-specific monitoring plans must align with quarterly reporting periods
- Forensic data extraction systems are essential for managing complex supply chain documentation

## CBAM Quarterly Reporting Calendar and Legal Framework

Under Article 33 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, authorized CBAM declarants must submit quarterly reports covering embedded emissions for all imported goods within scope. The reporting calendar follows standard EU administrative quarters:

- **Q1 Report**: Due 30 April (covering January-March imports)
- **Q2 Report**: Due 31 July (covering April-June imports)
- **Q3 Report**: Due 31 October (covering July-September imports)
- **Q4 Report**: Due 31 January (covering October-December imports)

Each quarterly report must contain aggregated embedded emissions data for all installations producing goods under the same CN Code classification. For Indian steel manufacturers, this typically involves multiple production facilities contributing to a single export consignment.

The transitional period through 31 December 2025 requires only emissions reporting without financial obligations. However, the reporting methodology and data quality standards remain identical to the definitive period commencing 1 January 2026.

Competent authorities in each Member State maintain oversight of quarterly submissions. Late submissions or data deficiencies can result in requests for additional information under Article 30, potentially delaying customs clearance for subsequent shipments.

## Installation-Level Data Aggregation Requirements

Quarterly reports must present embedded emissions data at the installation level, not the company level. This distinction proves critical for Indian manufacturers operating multiple production facilities.

Each installation requires separate identification through:

- **Installation ID**: Unique identifier assigned during initial CBAM registration
- **Geographic Coordinates**: Precise location data for each production facility
- **Production Capacity**: Annual rated capacity for relevant CBAM goods
- **Monitoring Plan Reference**: Link to approved monitoring methodology

For steel producers, embedded emissions calculations must account for all direct emissions from the installation plus indirect emissions from electricity consumption. The calculation methodology follows Annex III of Regulation (EU) 2023/956, requiring:

- Direct CO2 emissions from combustion processes
- Process emissions from chemical reactions
- Indirect emissions from electricity consumption
- Embedded emissions from precursor materials

Precursor materials present particular complexity for steel manufacturers. Iron ore, coking coal, and ferroalloys each carry embedded emissions that must be traced through the production process. Default values remain available during the transitional period, but actual data provides significant competitive advantages.

Systems like CarbonSettle enable forensic data extraction from installation-level monitoring systems, ensuring accurate aggregation across multiple production facilities and precursor supply chains.

## Documentation and Evidence Requirements

Quarterly reports must be supported by verifiable documentation demonstrating the accuracy of embedded emissions calculations. The evidentiary standard mirrors that required for EU ETS installations under Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2018/2066.

Required documentation includes:

- **Production Records**: Monthly production data for each CBAM good
- **Energy Consumption Data**: Fuel consumption and electricity usage records
- **Precursor Material Certificates**: Embedded emissions documentation for all input materials
- **Monitoring Plan Compliance**: Evidence of adherence to approved monitoring methodology
- **Verification Reports**: Third-party verification during the definitive period

Documentation must be retained for five years following submission, accessible for competent authority inspections. Digital documentation systems prove essential given the volume of supporting evidence required for complex steel production operations.

For Indian manufacturers, particular attention must be paid to precursor material documentation. Domestic iron ore and imported coking coal require different documentation approaches, with imported materials potentially carrying CBAM obligations from their countries of origin.

The XML reporting format specified in Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) 2023/1773 requires structured data presentation. Manual compilation proves impractical for installations with significant production volumes, necessitating automated data extraction and formatting systems.

## Common Compliance Pitfalls and Risk Mitigation

Experience from the transitional period reveals recurring compliance failures that compliance officers must actively prevent:

**Incomplete Precursor Tracking**: Many manufacturers fail to capture embedded emissions from all precursor materials. Steel production typically involves dozens of input materials, each potentially carrying embedded emissions obligations. Compliance officers must maintain comprehensive precursor registries covering all materials above de minimis thresholds.

**Installation Boundary Errors**: Incorrect definition of installation boundaries leads to incomplete emissions reporting. The installation concept under CBAM follows EU ETS precedent, encompassing all equipment and activities under unified technical management at a single geographic location. Shared utilities or off-site storage facilities may require separate treatment.

**Default Value Misapplication**: Default values provide compliance backstops but must be applied correctly according to Annex II methodologies. Mixing actual data with default values requires careful documentation of the boundary between measured and default emissions sources.

**Temporal Misalignment**: Production timing must align with import timing for quarterly reporting purposes. Steel produced in Q4 but imported in Q1 belongs in the Q1 report, not the Q4 report. This temporal tracking proves complex for manufacturers with extended production cycles.

**Currency and Unit Conversions**: Embedded emissions must be reported in tonnes CO2 equivalent, while production data may be maintained in different units. Currency conversions for electricity pricing require careful attention to exchange rates and timing.

Compliance officers should implement systematic controls addressing each potential failure mode. Regular internal audits during the transitional period provide opportunities to identify and correct systematic errors before the definitive period commences.

## Technology Integration and Automated Compliance Systems

Manual quarterly reporting proves unsustainable for installations with significant production volumes. Automated compliance systems must integrate with existing ERP and production monitoring systems to extract relevant data systematically.

Key integration requirements include:

- **Production Data Extraction**: Automated extraction of production volumes by product type and time period
- **Energy Consumption Monitoring**: Real-time capture of fuel consumption and electricity usage data
- **Precursor Material Tracking**: Supply chain integration capturing embedded emissions from all input materials
- **XML Generation**: Automated formatting of compliance data according to EU specifications
- **Documentation Management**: Systematic retention and organization of supporting evidence

CarbonSettle provides forensic data extraction capabilities specifically designed for CBAM compliance, integrating with existing manufacturing systems to automate quarterly report generation while maintaining full audit trails.

The technology architecture must accommodate future regulatory changes, including the transition to financial obligations in 2026. Systems designed solely for transitional period reporting may require significant modifications as CBAM certificate purchasing requirements take effect.

Cloud-based systems offer advantages for Indian manufacturers, providing access to EU-based data processing while maintaining compliance with local data protection requirements. However, data sovereignty considerations may influence system architecture decisions for strategic manufacturing operations.

Integration testing should commence well before quarterly deadlines, allowing time to identify and resolve data quality issues. The complexity of steel production processes means that automated systems require extensive validation against manual calculations before deployment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What happens if we miss a quarterly reporting deadline due to technical issues with our data systems?**

A: Late submissions trigger enforcement actions by the relevant Member State competent authority under Article 30 of Regulation (EU) 2023/956. The authority may request additional information or impose administrative measures. Technical system failures do not provide automatic extensions, though competent authorities retain discretion in exceptional circumstances. Compliance officers should maintain backup reporting procedures and submit preliminary reports by the deadline with corrections following promptly. Document all technical issues thoroughly to support any requests for regulatory forbearance.

**Q: How do we handle embedded emissions for steel products that use both domestic Indian raw materials and imported precursors subject to their own CBAM obligations?**

A: Each precursor material requires separate embedded emissions accounting regardless of origin. Domestic Indian materials use actual data where available or appropriate default values from Annex II. Imported precursors subject to CBAM carry their own embedded emissions documentation from the exporting country. The total embedded emissions for your steel products equals the sum of direct emissions from your installation plus embedded emissions from all precursors, both domestic and imported. Maintain separate tracking systems for each precursor category to ensure accurate aggregation in quarterly reports.

**Q: During the transitional period, can we switch between actual data and default values for the same installation across different quarterly reports?**

A: Yes, but with important limitations. You may use actual data when available and default values when actual data cannot be reasonably obtained, but the boundary between actual and default data must be clearly documented and justified. However, once you establish actual data collection for a particular emissions source, competent authorities expect continued actual data reporting unless circumstances genuinely prevent it. Switching back to default values after reporting actual data requires explicit justification in your quarterly submission. The goal is progression toward complete actual data reporting before the definitive period begins in 2026.
