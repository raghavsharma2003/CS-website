## Understanding CBAM Classification for Aerospace Steel Products

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 encompasses all steel products within CN codes 7208-7229, including specialized aerospace grade steels. These premium products, characterized by stringent quality specifications and controlled chemical compositions, present unique challenges for carbon accounting and regulatory compliance.

Aerospace grade steels typically include ultra-high strength steels (UHSS), precipitation-hardened stainless steels, and specialized alloys meeting aerospace industry standards such as AMS (Aerospace Material Specifications) or ASTM A564. The carbon intensity of these products varies significantly based on production routes, with electric arc furnace (EAF) routes typically generating 0.8-1.2 tCO2e per tonne, while blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) routes produce 2.1-2.8 tCO2e per tonne.

The regulatory framework treats aerospace grade steels identically to commodity steel products for CBAM purposes, despite their premium nature and specialized production requirements. This classification approach necessitates comprehensive carbon footprint documentation across the entire production chain, from raw material extraction through final product delivery.

## Carbon Intensity Calculations for Premium Steel Grades

Aerospace grade steel production involves additional processing steps that significantly impact carbon intensity calculations. Secondary refining processes, including vacuum degassing, electroslag remelting (ESR), and vacuum arc remelting (VAR), contribute an additional 0.3-0.7 tCO2e per tonne to the base steel production emissions.

The carbon accounting methodology requires detailed tracking of electricity consumption during specialized heat treatment processes. Aerospace grade steels typically undergo controlled atmosphere heat treatment cycles consuming 150-300 kWh per tonne. Using India's current electricity grid emission factor of 0.82 tCO2e per MWh, this represents an additional 0.12-0.25 tCO2e per tonne of embedded emissions.

Quality control processes, including non-destructive testing, chemical analysis, and mechanical property verification, contribute marginal but measurable carbon emissions. These activities typically account for 0.02-0.05 tCO2e per tonne, requiring documentation under the comprehensive carbon accounting framework.

Upstream emissions from specialized alloying elements present particular challenges. Nickel, chromium, and molybdenum additions common in aerospace grades carry significant embedded carbon footprints ranging from 8-15 tCO2e per tonne of alloying element. Precise documentation of alloy compositions and supplier-specific emission factors becomes critical for accurate carbon intensity determination.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transition from the current reporting-only phase to full financial implementation in January 2026 will significantly impact Indian aerospace steel exporters. The European Commission's preliminary carbon price projections indicate CBAM certificate costs of €60-85 per tonne CO2 for the 2025-2026 period, representing substantial financial exposure for carbon-intensive production routes.

Indian aerospace steel manufacturers must prepare for enhanced verification requirements beginning January 2025. The implementing regulation mandates third-party verification of carbon intensity declarations for all steel products exceeding 1,000 tonnes annual export volume to the EU. This threshold captures most aerospace grade steel exporters, given typical production volumes of 2,000-15,000 tonnes annually per specialized grade.

The regulatory impact extends beyond direct carbon costs to encompass administrative burden escalation. Starting 2025, quarterly CBAM reports must include detailed production route documentation, electricity source verification, and upstream supplier carbon intensity data. Non-compliance penalties escalate from warning notices to financial penalties equivalent to 1.5 times the applicable CBAM certificate price.

Market intelligence indicates EU aerospace manufacturers are increasingly prioritizing low-carbon steel suppliers in procurement decisions. This trend accelerates the competitive disadvantage for high-carbon intensity Indian producers, potentially resulting in market share erosion of 15-25% for non-compliant suppliers by 2026.

## Documentation and Verification Requirements

Aerospace grade steel exporters must establish comprehensive documentation systems addressing specific CBAM requirements. The regulatory framework mandates retention of production records for seven years, including detailed energy consumption data, raw material sourcing documentation, and process-specific emission calculations.

Production route verification requires detailed documentation of steelmaking processes, including furnace type, energy sources, and secondary refining operations. Aerospace grade steel producers must maintain records of vacuum degassing operations, including power consumption, process duration, and atmospheric control systems. These specialized processes require specific emission factor documentation not covered in standard steel production guidelines.

Electricity consumption documentation presents particular challenges for aerospace steel facilities utilizing multiple power sources. The regulation requires hourly electricity consumption tracking with corresponding grid emission factors or renewable energy certificates. Indian facilities must document power purchase agreements, captive power generation, and grid electricity consumption with appropriate emission factors validated by accredited verification bodies.

Upstream emissions documentation encompasses all raw materials and intermediate products. Aerospace grade steel producers must obtain carbon intensity declarations from iron ore suppliers, coking coal providers, and specialized alloy manufacturers. This requirement extends to imported raw materials, necessitating coordination with international suppliers to obtain compliant carbon intensity data.

## Cost Implications and Financial Planning

The financial impact of CBAM compliance on aerospace grade steel exports varies significantly based on production routes and carbon intensity levels. Current analysis indicates total compliance costs ranging from €25-65 per tonne of exported steel, encompassing CBAM certificate purchases, administrative costs, and verification expenses.

Direct CBAM certificate costs represent the largest financial exposure. Aerospace grade steels produced via BF-BOF routes with carbon intensities of 2.5-3.2 tCO2e per tonne face certificate costs of €150-272 per tonne at projected 2026 carbon prices. EAF-based production routes with carbon intensities of 1.0-1.4 tCO2e per tonne face significantly lower certificate costs of €60-119 per tonne.

Administrative compliance costs include carbon accounting system implementation, third-party verification services, and regulatory reporting infrastructure. Initial system setup costs range from €50,000-200,000 depending on facility complexity and existing environmental management systems. Annual operating costs for CBAM compliance typically range from €15,000-45,000 per facility.

Verification costs represent an ongoing expense beginning in 2025. Third-party verification services for aerospace grade steel facilities typically cost €8,000-15,000 annually, depending on production complexity and data quality. These costs scale with export volumes and product diversity, potentially reaching €25,000-40,000 annually for large multi-grade producers.

## Strategic Compliance Recommendations

Indian aerospace grade steel exporters should prioritize immediate implementation of comprehensive carbon accounting systems. The transitional period provides critical time for data collection, system optimization, and supplier engagement before full financial implementation. Early adopters gain competitive advantages through improved carbon intensity documentation and potential cost optimization opportunities.

Investment in low-carbon production technologies becomes economically justified under CBAM cost structures. Electric arc furnace upgrades, renewable energy integration, and energy efficiency improvements generate direct CBAM cost savings exceeding traditional payback calculations. Carbon intensity reductions of 0.5 tCO2e per tonne translate to annual CBAM savings of €30-42.5 per tonne at projected certificate prices.

Supplier engagement programs should prioritize upstream carbon intensity reduction. Collaborative initiatives with iron ore suppliers, coking coal providers, and alloy manufacturers can achieve system-wide carbon intensity improvements. Joint investment in low-carbon raw material production creates shared value and competitive differentiation in EU markets.

Market positioning strategies should emphasize carbon intensity advantages where applicable. EAF-based aerospace steel producers possess inherent carbon intensity advantages warranting premium pricing strategies. Marketing materials should highlight specific carbon intensity values and CBAM compliance readiness to differentiate from high-carbon competitors.
