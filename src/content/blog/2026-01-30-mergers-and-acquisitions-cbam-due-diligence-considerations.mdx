## Key Takeaways

- CBAM obligations create material contingent liabilities requiring forensic assessment during M&A due diligence processes
- Target companies with EU steel exports face potential carbon costs of €50-80 per tonne CO2 equivalent under full CBAM implementation
- Due diligence must evaluate historical emissions data quality, monitoring systems, and regulatory compliance frameworks
- Acquisition structures must account for CBAM certificate obligations transferring with operational assets
- Post-merger integration requires harmonization of carbon accounting methodologies across combined entities

## CBAM Liability Assessment Framework

The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism under Regulation (EU) 2023/956 introduces unprecedented carbon-related contingent liabilities that fundamentally alter the risk profile of cross-border M&A transactions. For Indian steel exporters considering acquisitions or facing acquisition interest, CBAM compliance obligations represent material financial exposures requiring systematic forensic evaluation.

Due diligence protocols must establish comprehensive carbon liability baselines encompassing direct emissions, indirect electricity-related emissions, and embedded carbon in raw materials. The regulatory framework mandates detailed emissions reporting for steel products exported to EU markets, creating data-dependent compliance obligations that transfer with operational assets during ownership changes.

Target company assessment requires evaluation of existing monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems against CBAM technical requirements. Companies lacking robust carbon accounting infrastructure face implementation costs ranging from $2-5 million for comprehensive MRV system deployment, representing material pre-closing remediation obligations.

## Emissions Data Quality Evaluation

Forensic carbon auditing during M&A due diligence demands rigorous assessment of historical emissions data integrity and methodological consistency. CBAM regulations require installation-level emissions reporting with quarterly granularity, necessitating evaluation of target companies' existing data collection and validation processes.

Due diligence teams must verify the accuracy of Scope 1 emissions calculations, including process emissions from coking coal consumption, limestone decomposition, and fuel combustion across integrated steel production facilities. Historical data gaps or methodological inconsistencies create compliance risks requiring quantification and remediation planning.

Indirect emissions from electricity consumption require separate evaluation, particularly for companies operating in regions with carbon-intensive grid electricity. The CBAM framework applies default emission factors where installation-specific data is unavailable, potentially resulting in higher carbon costs than actual emissions justify.

Third-party verification requirements under CBAM create additional due diligence considerations. Target companies must demonstrate capability to obtain accredited verification services for emissions reporting, with verification costs typically ranging 0.1-0.3% of annual revenue for large steel producers.

## Regulatory Compliance Infrastructure

M&A due diligence must evaluate target companies' regulatory compliance infrastructure against CBAM operational requirements. The mechanism demands quarterly reporting submissions, certificate purchasing obligations, and detailed documentation maintenance spanning multiple regulatory jurisdictions.

Assessment protocols should examine existing environmental management systems, regulatory affairs capabilities, and cross-border trade compliance frameworks. Companies lacking dedicated CBAM compliance resources face operational risks during the transitional period extending through 2026.

Legal entity structure evaluation becomes critical where target companies operate through multiple subsidiaries or joint ventures. CBAM obligations attach to specific installations and production processes, requiring careful mapping of regulatory responsibilities across corporate structures.

International trade documentation systems require evaluation for CBAM-specific data requirements. Export declarations must include detailed emissions information, necessitating integration between carbon accounting systems and trade compliance processes.

## Financial Impact Quantification

CBAM implementation creates direct financial obligations requiring precise quantification during M&A valuation processes. Full mechanism implementation in 2026 will impose carbon costs equivalent to EU ETS allowance prices on covered imports, with current forward prices indicating costs of €60-75 per tonne CO2 equivalent.

For typical integrated steel production generating 2.0-2.5 tonnes CO2 per tonne of steel, CBAM obligations represent additional costs of €120-188 per tonne of exported steel products. These costs directly impact gross margins and require incorporation into discounted cash flow analyses and purchase price adjustments.

Working capital implications arise from CBAM certificate purchasing requirements. Companies must maintain adequate certificate inventories to cover quarterly surrender obligations, creating additional financing requirements and cash flow considerations.

Currency exposure evaluation becomes necessary where CBAM certificates are denominated in euros while target companies operate in local currencies. Exchange rate volatility creates additional financial risks requiring hedging strategy assessment.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period concluding in December 2026 creates specific M&A timing considerations and integration planning requirements. Companies completing acquisitions during this period face compressed timelines for CBAM compliance system implementation across combined entities.

Regulatory uncertainty regarding final implementation details creates additional due diligence complexity. The European Commission continues developing technical guidance on verification requirements, default values, and administrative procedures, requiring flexible compliance frameworks capable of adapting to evolving requirements.

Post-2026 implementation will introduce full financial obligations, making pre-acquisition CBAM readiness assessment critical for accurate valuation and risk assessment. Companies lacking adequate preparation face potential market access restrictions or prohibitive compliance costs.

Integration planning must account for harmonizing carbon accounting methodologies across acquired entities. Disparate systems and methodologies create operational inefficiencies and compliance risks requiring systematic remediation.

## Integration and Harmonization Strategies

Post-merger integration requires systematic harmonization of carbon accounting and CBAM compliance processes across combined entities. Due diligence findings should inform integration planning and resource allocation for unified compliance frameworks.

Technology system integration becomes critical where acquired companies operate different emissions monitoring and reporting platforms. Standardization on common MRV systems enables operational efficiencies and reduces ongoing compliance costs.

Personnel integration requires assessment of specialized CBAM compliance expertise across combined organizations. The mechanism's technical complexity demands dedicated resources with specific regulatory knowledge and carbon accounting capabilities.

Supply chain integration considerations arise where acquired companies source raw materials from different suppliers with varying carbon intensities. Harmonized procurement strategies can optimize overall carbon footprints and reduce CBAM obligations.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do CBAM obligations transfer during asset acquisitions versus stock acquisitions?**
A: CBAM obligations attach to specific installations and production processes. In asset acquisitions, buyers must assume ongoing compliance responsibilities for acquired facilities. Stock acquisitions transfer all existing CBAM obligations with the target entity, including any historical compliance deficiencies.

**Q: What documentation should buyers request regarding target companies' CBAM readiness?**
A: Essential documentation includes emissions monitoring procedures, historical emissions data, verification reports, regulatory correspondence, compliance cost estimates, and implementation timelines for required system upgrades.

**Q: How should buyers evaluate CBAM-related warranties and indemnities?**
A: Sellers should provide specific warranties regarding emissions data accuracy, regulatory compliance status, and adequacy of monitoring systems. Indemnities should cover pre-closing compliance deficiencies and implementation cost overruns for identified system deficiencies.

**Q: What role do environmental consultants play in CBAM due diligence?**
A: Specialized carbon auditing firms provide technical assessment of emissions data quality, MRV system adequacy, and compliance gap identification. Their involvement is essential for accurate risk assessment and remediation cost estimation.

**Q: How do joint ventures complicate CBAM due diligence?**
A: Joint ventures create shared compliance obligations requiring careful allocation of responsibilities and costs. Due diligence must evaluate existing joint venture agreements for CBAM-related provisions and assess modification requirements for compliance allocation.
