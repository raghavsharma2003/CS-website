## Understanding Indirect Emissions in Induction Furnace Operations

Induction furnace steel production represents a critical segment of India's secondary steel manufacturing sector, processing approximately 45 million tonnes annually through electric melting processes. Under the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), these facilities face unprecedented scrutiny regarding their indirect emissions profile, particularly electricity-related carbon footprint calculations.

Indirect emissions, classified as Scope 2 emissions under international carbon accounting standards, encompass all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from purchased electricity, steam, heating, and cooling consumed by the steel production facility. For induction furnace operations, electricity consumption dominates this category, typically accounting for 450-550 kWh per tonne of liquid steel produced.

The regulatory framework established by Regulation (EU) 2023/956 mandates comprehensive documentation of emission sources, requiring steel exporters to demonstrate verifiable carbon intensity calculations. This regulation specifically addresses the carbon leakage concerns within energy-intensive industries, establishing a mechanism to ensure environmental integrity across international trade boundaries.

Induction furnace facilities must now implement robust measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems that capture real-time electricity consumption data, correlate this consumption with grid emission factors, and maintain auditable records for EU customs authorities. The complexity increases when facilities operate multiple furnaces with varying operational schedules, requiring granular allocation methodologies.

## Electricity Grid Emission Factor Determination

The foundation of accurate indirect emissions calculation lies in establishing precise electricity grid emission factors for the specific geographical location and time period of steel production. Indian steel producers must navigate a complex landscape of regional grid variations, with emission factors ranging from 0.82 kg CO₂/kWh in states with high renewable penetration to 1.15 kg CO₂/kWh in coal-dependent regions.

Grid emission factors exhibit temporal variations based on seasonal renewable energy availability, peak demand periods, and maintenance schedules of thermal power plants. Induction furnace operators must implement hourly or sub-hourly tracking systems to capture these variations, particularly when facilities operate flexible production schedules to optimize electricity costs.

The Central Electricity Authority of India publishes regional grid emission factors quarterly, but EU CBAM requirements may necessitate more frequent updates to ensure compliance with the "best available information" standard. Steel exporters must establish data collection protocols that interface with state load dispatch centers to obtain real-time grid composition data.

For facilities with captive power generation or renewable energy procurement agreements, emission factor calculations become more complex. Direct renewable energy consumption must be separately tracked and documented, with appropriate certificates of origin maintained for audit purposes. The temporal matching of renewable energy generation with steel production schedules requires sophisticated energy management systems.

Power purchase agreements (PPAs) with specific renewable energy projects allow for near-zero emission factors, but require comprehensive documentation including generation profiles, transmission losses, and additionality assessments. These arrangements can significantly reduce the carbon intensity of induction furnace operations when properly structured and documented.

## Measurement and Monitoring Infrastructure Requirements

Implementing compliant indirect emissions monitoring for induction furnace operations requires substantial infrastructure investments in measurement equipment, data management systems, and quality assurance protocols. The technical requirements extend beyond simple electricity meter readings to encompass comprehensive energy flow analysis throughout the production facility.

Primary measurement infrastructure must include certified electricity meters capable of recording consumption data at minimum 15-minute intervals, with data logging capabilities extending over multi-year periods. These meters must meet international accuracy standards (IEC 62053 series) and undergo regular calibration to maintain measurement uncertainty within ±2% tolerance levels.

Secondary measurement systems should monitor auxiliary equipment consumption including cooling systems, material handling equipment, pollution control devices, and facility lighting. This granular approach ensures complete capture of electricity-related emissions attributable to steel production activities versus general facility operations.

Data acquisition systems must interface with multiple measurement points, providing centralized collection, validation, and storage of consumption data. These systems require redundant communication pathways to prevent data loss during network interruptions and must incorporate automated data quality checks to identify measurement anomalies or equipment malfunctions.

Integration with existing plant control systems enables correlation of electricity consumption with production parameters such as furnace temperature profiles, melting rates, and steel grade specifications. This correlation capability supports allocation of indirect emissions to specific product batches when facilities produce multiple steel grades with varying energy intensities.

## Allocation Methodologies for Multi-Product Facilities

Induction furnace facilities producing multiple steel grades or operating concurrent production lines require sophisticated allocation methodologies to assign indirect emissions to specific products destined for EU markets. The allocation approach must demonstrate technical accuracy, economic reasonableness, and regulatory compliance with EU CBAM requirements.

Mass-based allocation represents the most straightforward approach, distributing total facility indirect emissions proportionally based on steel production tonnage. This method suits facilities producing similar steel grades with comparable energy intensities but may inadequately reflect actual emission variations between product types.

Energy-based allocation provides greater accuracy by correlating electricity consumption with specific production activities. This approach requires detailed energy monitoring for individual furnace operations, with allocation factors derived from actual kWh consumption per tonne of steel produced. The methodology must account for varying melting efficiencies based on scrap composition, steel chemistry requirements, and operational parameters.

Economic allocation methods distribute emissions based on relative product values, reflecting the principle that higher-value products should bear proportionally greater emission responsibility. This approach requires current market pricing data and may introduce volatility in emission allocations due to steel price fluctuations.

Hybrid allocation methodologies combine multiple approaches to optimize accuracy while maintaining practical implementation feasibility. For example, facilities might employ energy-based allocation for direct production activities while using mass-based allocation for general facility operations such as lighting and administration.

The selected allocation methodology must remain consistent across reporting periods unless justified by significant operational changes. Documentation requirements include detailed methodology descriptions, supporting calculations, and periodic validation studies to demonstrate continued appropriateness of the chosen approach.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional implementation period for EU CBAM during 2025-2026 presents both opportunities and challenges for Indian induction furnace steel producers. This phase emphasizes reporting obligations without immediate financial penalties, allowing facilities to refine their indirect emissions calculation methodologies while building compliance infrastructure.

Quarterly reporting requirements during this period will test the robustness of measurement systems and data management protocols. Facilities must demonstrate capability to generate comprehensive emission reports within 31 days of quarter-end, including detailed breakdowns of electricity consumption, emission factors applied, and allocation methodologies employed.

The European Commission's technical guidance documents, expected for release in early 2025, will provide additional clarity on acceptable calculation methodologies, documentation requirements, and verification standards. These documents may introduce sector-specific requirements for steel production that could necessitate methodology adjustments for induction furnace operations.

Verification requirements during the transitional period will establish precedents for the full implementation phase beginning in 2027. Independent verification bodies must assess the accuracy and completeness of indirect emissions calculations, requiring facilities to maintain comprehensive audit trails and supporting documentation.

Market dynamics during 2025-2026 may favor steel producers with demonstrably low carbon intensities, creating competitive advantages for facilities investing in renewable energy procurement and advanced monitoring systems. Early compliance leaders may establish preferred supplier relationships with EU importers seeking to minimize future CBAM obligations.

## Documentation and Verification Standards

Comprehensive documentation protocols form the cornerstone of compliant indirect emissions reporting for induction furnace steel production. The documentation framework must satisfy both EU CBAM requirements and international carbon accounting standards while supporting independent verification processes.

Primary documentation includes electricity consumption records with timestamps, meter readings, and consumption allocation to specific production activities. These records must demonstrate traceability from raw meter data through calculation processes to final emission reports, with clear audit trails maintained throughout the data lifecycle.

Supporting documentation encompasses electricity supplier contracts, grid emission factor sources, renewable energy certificates, and power purchase agreement terms. Each document must include version control, effective dates, and authorized signatures to establish authenticity and prevent unauthorized modifications.

Calculation worksheets must detail the mathematical processes used to convert electricity consumption data into CO₂ equivalent emissions, including emission factors applied, allocation methodologies employed, and any adjustments made for data quality issues. These worksheets serve as the foundation for verification activities and regulatory submissions.

Quality assurance documentation includes equipment calibration certificates, data validation procedures, and corrective action records for identified discrepancies. This documentation demonstrates the facility's commitment to measurement accuracy and continuous improvement in emission calculation processes.

Verification standards require independent assessment of calculation methodologies, data quality, and documentation completeness by accredited verification bodies. The verification process includes on-site inspections, data sampling, and recalculation exercises to confirm reported emission values within acceptable uncertainty ranges.
