## Understanding Embedded Emissions in Steel Production

Embedded emissions in steel production represent the total greenhouse gas emissions generated throughout the manufacturing process, from raw material extraction to finished product delivery. For Indian steel exporters targeting EU markets, accurate calculation of these emissions has become mandatory under the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).

The embedded emissions calculation encompasses direct emissions from steel production processes (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from electricity consumption (Scope 2). This comprehensive approach ensures that carbon leakage prevention measures capture the full environmental impact of steel manufacturing operations.

Indian steel facilities must establish robust monitoring systems to track emissions at the installation level. The calculation methodology requires detailed documentation of fuel consumption patterns, electricity usage profiles, and process-specific emission factors. These parameters form the foundation for determining the carbon intensity of steel products destined for European markets.

The regulatory framework mandates that embedded emissions calculations follow internationally recognized standards, including ISO 14064 and the GHG Protocol. Indian exporters must align their calculation methodologies with these standards to ensure regulatory compliance and market access continuity.

## Methodology Framework for Emission Calculations

The calculation of embedded emissions follows a systematic approach that begins with the identification of emission sources within the steel production facility. Primary emission sources include coking coal combustion, iron ore reduction processes, electric arc furnace operations, and auxiliary energy consumption.

Facility operators must establish emission boundaries that clearly define which processes and activities contribute to the embedded carbon footprint. The boundary setting process requires careful consideration of upstream and downstream activities, ensuring that all relevant emission sources are captured within the calculation scope.

Data collection procedures must meet stringent quality requirements, with continuous monitoring systems providing real-time emission data. Indian steel facilities typically employ continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS) for major point sources, supplemented by periodic measurements for fugitive emissions and smaller sources.

The calculation methodology incorporates activity data multiplied by appropriate emission factors. Activity data includes fuel consumption quantities, electricity usage volumes, and production output metrics. Emission factors must be facility-specific where possible, with default values applied only when site-specific data is unavailable.

Quality assurance protocols ensure data accuracy and completeness throughout the calculation process. These protocols include regular calibration of monitoring equipment, validation of calculation procedures, and independent verification of emission reports.

## Scope 1 Emissions Quantification

Scope 1 emissions represent direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the steel production facility. These emissions primarily result from combustion processes, chemical reactions, and fugitive releases occurring within the installation boundaries.

Coking operations constitute a significant source of Scope 1 emissions in integrated steel plants. The coking process involves heating coal in the absence of oxygen to produce coke for blast furnace operations. Emission calculations must account for CO2 releases from coal carbonization, methane emissions from coke oven gas handling, and fugitive emissions from battery operations.

Blast furnace operations generate substantial CO2 emissions through the reduction of iron ore using coke as a reducing agent. The chemical reaction between iron oxide and carbon produces metallic iron and carbon dioxide as byproducts. Accurate quantification requires monitoring of blast furnace gas composition and flow rates.

Electric arc furnace facilities, common in secondary steel production, generate Scope 1 emissions from electrode consumption and auxiliary fuel usage. Graphite electrodes undergo oxidation during the melting process, releasing CO2 that must be quantified and reported.

Auxiliary processes including lime production, oxygen generation, and waste gas flaring contribute additional Scope 1 emissions. These sources require individual assessment and quantification to ensure comprehensive emission accounting.

## Scope 2 Emissions Assessment

Scope 2 emissions encompass indirect greenhouse gas emissions from purchased electricity consumed during steel production operations. For Indian steel facilities, electricity consumption represents a significant component of total embedded emissions, particularly in electric arc furnace operations.

The calculation of Scope 2 emissions requires determination of the carbon intensity of consumed electricity. Indian steel facilities must obtain grid emission factors from the Central Electricity Authority or use facility-specific factors for captive power generation. The grid emission factor for India averages approximately 0.82 tCO2/MWh, though regional variations exist.

Electricity consumption data must be collected at sufficient granularity to support accurate emission calculations. This includes monitoring of major electrical equipment, production line consumption, and auxiliary system usage. Smart metering systems provide the necessary data resolution for comprehensive Scope 2 emission assessment.

Captive power generation requires separate treatment within the Scope 2 calculation framework. When steel facilities operate their own power generation equipment, emissions from fuel combustion are classified as Scope 1, while purchased electricity remains Scope 2.

The temporal matching of electricity consumption with grid emission factors enhances calculation accuracy. Hourly or sub-hourly matching provides more precise emission estimates compared to annual average factors, particularly important for facilities with variable production schedules.

## Installation-Level Carbon Intensity Determination

Installation-level carbon intensity represents the total embedded emissions per unit of steel production, expressed in tonnes CO2 equivalent per tonne of crude steel. This metric serves as the primary basis for CBAM obligation calculations under EU regulations.

The carbon intensity calculation aggregates Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions across all production processes within the installation boundary. Production output data must align temporally with emission data to ensure accurate intensity determination. Monthly or quarterly calculation periods provide sufficient granularity for regulatory reporting while maintaining operational practicality.

System boundaries for carbon intensity calculations must encompass all processes contributing to steel production, from raw material preparation to finished product completion. Integrated steel plants require comprehensive boundary definitions covering coking, sintering, iron-making, steel-making, and rolling operations.

Allocation methodologies become critical when facilities produce multiple steel grades or products. Mass-based allocation typically provides the most straightforward approach, though economic allocation may be appropriate for facilities with significant co-product streams.

Default emission factors serve as fallback values when facility-specific data is unavailable or insufficient. The European Commission has established default factors of 2.28 tCO2/tonne for crude steel production, though these values result in conservative estimates that may disadvantage efficient producers.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The transitional period for CBAM implementation extends through December 2026, during which Indian steel exporters must establish comprehensive emission calculation and reporting systems. This period provides critical time for methodology development, system implementation, and staff training.

Regulatory requirements intensify significantly beginning January 2027, when financial obligations commence under Regulation (EU) 2023/956. Indian exporters must prepare for mandatory purchase of CBAM certificates corresponding to the embedded emissions of their steel products. The certificate price will reflect EU ETS allowance prices, currently trading around €85-90 per tonne CO2.

Verification requirements become mandatory during the transitional period, with independent third-party verification of emission calculations and reports. Indian steel facilities must engage accredited verification bodies to ensure regulatory compliance and maintain market access.

The European Commission continues refining technical guidance documents throughout 2025-2026, with updates to default emission factors and calculation methodologies. Indian exporters must monitor these developments and adapt their systems accordingly to maintain compliance.

Capacity building initiatives supported by industry associations and government agencies provide essential resources for Indian steel exporters. These programs focus on technical training, system implementation support, and regulatory compliance guidance.

## Implementation Challenges and Solutions

Indian steel exporters face significant technical and operational challenges in implementing embedded emission calculation systems. Legacy production facilities often lack the monitoring infrastructure necessary for comprehensive emission tracking, requiring substantial capital investment in measurement equipment.

Data management systems must be upgraded to handle the volume and complexity of emission-related data. Integration between production control systems, emission monitoring equipment, and reporting platforms requires careful planning and execution.

Staff training represents a critical success factor, with personnel requiring specialized knowledge in greenhouse gas accounting, verification procedures, and regulatory compliance. Training programs must address both technical and administrative aspects of emission calculation and reporting.

Third-party verification services remain limited in the Indian market, creating potential bottlenecks as demand increases. Early engagement with verification bodies and long-term service agreements help ensure availability of required services.

Cost implications of CBAM compliance extend beyond direct emission calculation expenses to include verification fees, system upgrades, and ongoing operational costs. Financial planning must account for these additional expenses while maintaining competitive positioning in EU markets.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What happens if facility-specific emission data is unavailable?**
When facility-specific data is unavailable, exporters must use default emission factors established by the European Commission. For steel products, the default factor is 2.28 tCO2/tonne crude steel. However, using default factors typically results in higher emission values compared to actual facility performance, potentially increasing CBAM obligations.

**How often must embedded emission calculations be updated?**
Emission calculations must be updated quarterly for CBAM reporting purposes. However, facilities should maintain continuous monitoring systems to ensure data availability and accuracy. Monthly calculations provide better operational control and facilitate quarterly reporting preparation.

**Can Indian steel exporters use international carbon credits to offset embedded emissions?**
No, international carbon credits cannot be used to reduce embedded emissions for CBAM purposes. The mechanism specifically targets actual emissions from production processes, and only direct emission reductions at the facility level are recognized.

**What verification standards apply to embedded emission calculations?**
Verification must follow ISO 14064-3 standards or equivalent internationally recognized frameworks. Verification bodies must be accredited by national accreditation bodies and demonstrate competence in steel industry emission assessment.

**How do co-products affect embedded emission calculations?**
When steel facilities produce multiple products, emissions must be allocated among products using appropriate methodologies. Mass-based allocation is typically preferred, though economic allocation may be justified for facilities with significant co-product revenues. The allocation methodology must be consistently applied and clearly documented.
