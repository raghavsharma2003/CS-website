## Fundamental Technology Differences in Carbon Intensity

The carbon footprint differential between Electric Arc Furnace and Blast Furnace steelmaking represents one of the most critical factors determining EU CBAM liability for Indian exporters. Electric Arc Furnaces operate through electrical energy input to melt recycled steel scrap, while Blast Furnaces rely on metallurgical coal and coke as both energy source and reducing agent for iron ore processing.

EAF operations typically generate 0.4-0.8 tonnes CO₂ per tonne of crude steel, depending primarily on electricity grid carbon intensity and scrap steel quality. This emission range reflects the technology's reliance on electrical energy rather than fossil fuel combustion for primary heat generation. The carbon intensity calculation for EAF operations must account for indirect emissions from electricity consumption, which varies significantly based on regional grid composition.

Blast Furnace integrated steelmaking, incorporating Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) conversion, generates substantially higher emissions ranging from 2.0-2.3 tonnes CO₂ per tonne of crude steel. This emission intensity stems from the fundamental chemistry of iron ore reduction, where carbon monoxide serves as the primary reducing agent, inevitably producing CO₂ as a reaction byproduct. The process requires approximately 450-500 kg of metallurgical coal per tonne of hot metal, creating unavoidable process emissions beyond energy-related emissions.

The emission factor differential creates immediate competitive implications under CBAM implementation. Assuming a CBAM certificate price of €60 per tonne CO₂, EAF-produced steel faces potential CBAM costs of €24-48 per tonne, while BF-produced steel encounters €120-138 per tonne in CBAM obligations. This cost differential of €80-120 per tonne represents a substantial competitive advantage for EAF-based Indian exporters.

## CBAM Calculation Methodologies by Furnace Type

Regulation (EU) 2023/956 establishes distinct calculation pathways for determining embedded carbon content based on production methodology. EAF operations benefit from more straightforward emission calculations due to the technology's reliance on purchased electricity as the primary energy input, enabling clearer attribution of indirect emissions through grid emission factors.

For EAF facilities, the primary calculation components include direct emissions from electrode consumption, limestone flux usage, and any supplementary fuel combustion, plus indirect emissions from electricity consumption. The electricity component typically represents 70-80% of total emissions, calculated using either facility-specific Power Purchase Agreement emission factors or regional grid averages. Indian EAF operators must document electricity consumption data with hourly granularity to optimize emission factor calculations under CBAM requirements.

Blast Furnace emission calculations involve significantly more complex attribution requirements. Direct emissions encompass coke consumption, coal injection, limestone flux, and process gas combustion. The integrated nature of BF-BOF operations requires careful allocation of emissions between iron and steel production phases, particularly for facilities producing both merchant pig iron and finished steel products.

The calculation complexity extends to upstream emissions attribution. EAF operations must account for scrap steel embedded emissions, though CBAM regulations provide simplified methodologies for recycled content. BF operations require comprehensive tracking of iron ore, coking coal, and limestone supply chain emissions, creating substantially higher documentation burdens for CBAM compliance.

Default emission factors under CBAM regulations heavily penalize facilities lacking verified actual emissions data. The default factor for steel products reaches 2.61 tCO₂/tonne, significantly exceeding typical EAF actual emissions but potentially understating BF emissions. This regulatory structure creates strong incentives for EAF operators to invest in actual emissions verification systems while potentially providing temporary relief for high-emission BF facilities.

## 2025-2026 Regulatory Impact

The CBAM transitional period concluding in December 2025 establishes critical precedents for full financial implementation beginning January 2026. During 2025, Indian steel exporters must submit quarterly CBAM reports demonstrating actual emission calculations by production route, creating the foundational data systems required for subsequent financial obligations.

EAF facilities face lower compliance complexity during the transitional period, as electricity-based emission calculations align more readily with existing energy management systems. The primary challenge involves establishing verified electricity emission factors, particularly for facilities utilizing renewable energy sources or specific Power Purchase Agreements. Indian EAF operators should prioritize renewable electricity procurement documentation to minimize CBAM exposure from 2026 onwards.

BF facilities encounter substantially higher transitional period compliance burdens. The integrated nature of BF-BOF operations requires comprehensive mass balance calculations, process gas analysis, and upstream supply chain emission verification. Many Indian integrated steel plants lack the granular data collection systems necessary for accurate CBAM reporting, necessitating immediate investment in monitoring and verification infrastructure.

The 2026 financial implementation creates divergent strategic imperatives by furnace type. EAF operators should focus on electricity decarbonization strategies, including renewable energy procurement, energy storage systems, and grid balancing technologies. BF operators face more fundamental technology transition decisions, as incremental efficiency improvements provide limited emission reduction potential compared to the magnitude of CBAM financial exposure.

Regulatory guidance published throughout 2025 will establish critical precedents for emission factor verification, upstream attribution methodologies, and documentation requirements. Indian exporters utilizing both furnace technologies must maintain active engagement with EU regulatory developments to ensure compliance system adequacy for full CBAM implementation.

## Verification and Documentation Requirements

CBAM compliance necessitates distinct verification approaches based on furnace technology characteristics. EAF operations benefit from more standardized verification protocols due to the technology's reliance on measurable electricity inputs and well-established emission factors for electrical energy consumption.

EAF verification requirements focus primarily on electricity consumption measurement, electrode consumption tracking, and auxiliary material usage documentation. The electrical energy component requires hourly consumption data correlated with grid emission factors or specific supplier emission certificates. Indian EAF facilities must establish automated data collection systems capable of providing real-time electricity consumption data with sufficient granularity for CBAM reporting requirements.

Electrode consumption represents the primary direct emission source for EAF operations, requiring precise measurement of graphite electrode usage per production batch. The carbon content of electrodes creates predictable CO₂ emissions through oxidation during the melting process, enabling straightforward emission factor calculations. Documentation must include electrode supplier specifications, consumption rates per tonne of steel produced, and quality control data demonstrating consistent carbon content.

BF verification requirements encompass significantly more complex data collection and analysis protocols. Direct emissions verification requires continuous monitoring of coke consumption, coal injection rates, limestone usage, and process gas composition. The integrated nature of BF operations necessitates allocation methodologies for shared utilities, process gases, and energy recovery systems between iron and steel production phases.

Process gas analysis represents a critical verification component for BF operations, as blast furnace gas and coke oven gas utilization affects overall facility emission calculations. Indian integrated steel plants must install continuous emission monitoring systems capable of measuring CO₂ concentrations in process gas streams, requiring substantial capital investment in analytical equipment and data management systems.

Third-party verification requirements under CBAM regulations create additional compliance considerations. EAF facilities typically require annual verification audits focusing on electricity consumption measurement accuracy and emission factor application. BF facilities face more intensive verification requirements, including process engineering reviews, mass balance validations, and supply chain emission audits.

## Economic Implications for Indian Steel Exporters

The emission factor differential between EAF and BF technologies creates immediate and long-term economic implications for Indian steel exporters under CBAM implementation. Current market conditions demonstrate EAF cost advantages extending beyond carbon pricing to include operational flexibility, capital efficiency, and supply chain optimization.

EAF operations demonstrate superior economic resilience under CBAM implementation due to lower baseline emission factors and greater decarbonization potential. The technology's reliance on electricity enables direct correlation between renewable energy procurement and emission reduction, providing clear pathways for CBAM cost mitigation. Indian EAF operators can achieve emission factors below 0.4 tCO₂/tonne steel through strategic renewable energy contracts, creating substantial competitive advantages in EU markets.

Capital investment requirements for CBAM compliance differ significantly between furnace technologies. EAF facilities require primarily software and monitoring system upgrades, with typical compliance costs ranging from $0.5-1.0 million per facility. BF facilities face substantially higher compliance investment requirements, often exceeding $5-10 million per integrated plant for comprehensive monitoring, verification, and data management systems.

The economic impact extends to working capital requirements under full CBAM implementation. EAF-produced steel requires CBAM certificate purchases representing 2-4% of product value, while BF-produced steel faces CBAM costs representing 6-8% of product value. This differential creates cash flow advantages for EAF operators and potential financing challenges for BF-based exporters.

Market positioning implications favor EAF technology adoption for export-focused Indian steel producers. The emission factor advantage translates directly to price competitiveness in EU markets, potentially enabling premium pricing for low-carbon steel products. BF operators face pressure to invest in emission reduction technologies or accept reduced market share in carbon-sensitive applications.

## Strategic Technology Transition Considerations

The CBAM regulatory framework accelerates existing trends toward EAF technology adoption in the global steel industry. Indian steel producers must evaluate technology transition strategies considering both immediate CBAM compliance costs and long-term market positioning in increasingly carbon-constrained trade environments.

EAF technology expansion requires careful consideration of scrap steel availability and quality in Indian markets. Domestic scrap generation currently supports approximately 25-30% of Indian steel production through EAF routes, with import dependency for high-quality scrap creating supply chain vulnerabilities. Strategic scrap procurement agreements and domestic scrap quality improvement initiatives become critical for EAF capacity expansion.

Electricity grid decarbonization represents the primary pathway for EAF emission reduction in Indian contexts. Current grid emission factors of approximately 0.82 tCO₂/MWh limit EAF emission reduction potential without dedicated renewable energy procurement. Indian EAF operators should prioritize renewable energy contracts, potentially including captive solar installations and energy storage systems to minimize grid dependency.

BF technology faces fundamental limitations in emission reduction potential under current technological constraints. Carbon capture and utilization technologies remain commercially unproven at steel industry scale, while hydrogen-based direct reduction requires substantial infrastructure development and cost reduction. Indian BF operators must evaluate technology transition timelines against CBAM cost escalation projections.

The regulatory trajectory suggests expanding carbon border adjustment mechanisms beyond steel to aluminum, cement, and chemical products. Indian industrial policy should consider technology transition incentives favoring low-emission production routes to maintain export competitiveness across multiple carbon-intensive sectors.
